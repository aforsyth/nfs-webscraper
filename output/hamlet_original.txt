<T>
BARNARDO
Whos there?
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Long live the king!
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
Barnardo?
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
He.
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them.Stand, ho! Whos there?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved you?
</T>
<T>
FRANCISCO
Barnardo has my place. Give you good night.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Holla, Barnardo.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Say what, is Horatio there?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
A piece of him.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Welcome, Horatio.Welcome, good Marcellus.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appeared again tonight?
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
I have seen nothing.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Horatio says tis but our fantasy
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Tush, tush, twill not appear.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Sit down a while
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story,
What we have two nights seen.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star thats westward from the pole
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again!
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
In the same figure like the king thats dead.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
(to HORATIO) Thou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
Looks it not like the king? Mark it, Horatio.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
It would be spoke to.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
What art thou that usurpst this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee, speak.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
See, it stalks away.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone and will not answer.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on t?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself.
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated.
So frowned he once when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not,
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war,
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint laborer with the day?
Who is t that can inform me?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
That can I.
At least, the whisper goes so: our last king,
Whose image even but now appeared to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)
Did slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of to the conqueror,
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gagd by our king, which had returned
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same covenant
And carriage of the article designed,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimprovd mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in t, which is no other
As it doth well appear unto our state
But to recover of us, by strong hand
</T>
<T>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
Of this posthaste and rummage in the land.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so.
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armd through our watch so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the minds eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun, and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
And even the like precurse of feared events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.
</T>
<T>
But soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again.
Ill cross it though it blast me.Stay, illusion!
</T>
<T>
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,
Speak to me.
</T>
<T>
If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me.
If thou art privy to thy countrys fate,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
Oh, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it. Stay and speak!
</T>
<T>
Stop it, Marcellus.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
'Tis here.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
'Tis here.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone.
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence,
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
</T>
<T>
BARNARDO
It was about to speak when the cock crew.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day, and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine, and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long.
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad.
The nights are wholesome. Then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallowed and so gracious is that time.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
Break we our watch up, and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen tonight
Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
Lets do t, I pray, and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have weas twere with a defeated joy,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole
Taken to wife. Nor have we herein barred
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth
Or thinking by our late dear brothers death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagud with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not failed to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
</T>
<T>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
</T>
<T>
LAERTES
My necessaries are embarked. Farewell.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convey is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
</T>
<T>
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
</T>
<T>
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favor,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute.
No more.
</T>
<T>
OPHELIA
No more but so?
</T>
<T>
LAERTES
Think it no more.
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will, but you must fear.
His greatness weighed, his will is not his own,
For he himself is subject to his birth.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
What hour now?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve.
</T>
<T>
MARCELLUS
No, it is struck.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
</T>
<T>
What does this mean, my lord?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
The king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels,
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Is it a custom?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Ay, marry, is t.
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honored in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? Speak, Ill go no further.
</T>
<T>
GHOST
Mark me.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
I will.
</T>
<T>
GHOST
My hour is almost come
When I to sulfurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Alas, poor ghost!
</T>
<T>
GHOST
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Speak. I am bound to hear.
</T>
<T>
GHOST
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
What?
</T>
<T>
GHOST
I am thy fathers spirit,
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
</T>
<T>
POLONIUS
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
</T>
<T>
REYNALDO
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
POLONIUS
You shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.
</T>
<T>
REYNALDO
My lord, I did intend it.
</T>
<T>
POLONIUS
Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep
What company at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it.
Take you, as twere, some distant knowledge of him,
As thus: I know his father and his friends,
And, in part, him. Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
</T>
<T>
REYNALDO
Ay, very well, my lord.
</T>
<T>
POLONIUS
And in part him, but, you may say, not well.
But, if t be he I mean, hes very wild.
Addicted so and so. And there put on him
What forgeries you please. Marry, none so rank
As may dishonor him. Take heed of that.
But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlets transformationso call it
Since nor th' exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his fathers death, that thus hath put him
So much from th' understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
That, being of so young days brought up with him
And since so neighbored to his youth and 'havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus
That, opened, lies within our remedy.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you.
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a kings remembrance.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
And can you by no drift of conference
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
He does confess he feels himself distracted.
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
</T>
<T>
GUILDENSTERN
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded.
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Did he receive you well?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Most like a gentleman.
</T>
<T>
GUILDENSTERN
But with much forcing of his disposition.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Did you assay him?
To any pastime?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it, as many ofyour players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines.Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus, butuse all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I maysay) whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget atemperance that may give it smoothness. Oh, it offends meto the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of thegroundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothingbut inexplicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have sucha fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-HerodsHerod. Pray you, avoid it.
</T>
<T>
FIRST PLAYER
I warrant your honor.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be yourtutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action,with this special observance that you o'erstep not themodesty of nature. For anything so overdone is from thepurpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now,was and is to hold, as twere, the mirror up to nature, toshow virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and thevery age and body of the time his form and pressure. Nowthis overdone or come tardy off, though it make theunskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve, thecensure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigha whole theatre of others.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you.
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.
</T>
<T>
GUILDENSTERN
We will ourselves provide.
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many, many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
The single and peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and armor of the mind
To keep itself from noyance, but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone, but, like a gulf, doth draw
Whats near it with it. It is a massy wheel
Fixed on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage.
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.
</T>
<T>
POLONIUS
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screened and stood between
Much heat and him. Ill silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
(within) Mother, mother, mother!
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Ill warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Now mother, whats the matter?
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Mother, you have my father much offended.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Why, how now, Hamlet?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Whats the matter now?
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Have you forgot me?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
No, by the rood, not so.
You are the queen, your husbands brothers wife,
Andwould it were not so!you are my mother.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
(to GERTRUDE) Theres matter in these sighs, these profound heaves.
You must translate. 'Tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
(to ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN)
Bestow this place on us a little while.
</T>
<T>
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, A rat, a rat!
And in this brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there.
His liberty is full of threats to all
To you yourself, to us, to everyone.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrained and out of haunt,
This mad young man. But so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit,
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Safely stowed.
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMEN
(from within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?
Oh, here they come.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto tis kin.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Do not believe it.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, tobe demanded of a sponge! What replication should be madeby the son of a king?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
Hes loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes.
And where tis so, th' offenders scourge is weighed,
But never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
</T>
<T>
How now, what hath befall'n?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
But where is he?
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Bring him before us.
</T>
<T>
ROSENCRANTZ
Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Now, Hamlet, wheres Polonius?
</T>
<T>
FORTINBRAS
Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king
Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye,
And let him know so.
</T>
<T>
CAPTAIN
I will do t, my lord.
</T>
<T>
FORTINBRAS
Go softly on.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Good sir, whose powers are these?
</T>
<T>
CAPTAIN
They are of Norway, sir.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
</T>
<T>
CAPTAIN
Against some part of Poland.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Who commands them, sir?
</T>
<T>
CAPTAIN
The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
I will not speak with her.
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
She is importunate,
Indeed distract. Her mood will needs be pitied.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
What would she have?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
She speaks much of her father, says she hears
Theres tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection. They aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
'Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
</T>
<T>
GERTRUDE
Let her come in.
</T>
<T>
(aside) To my sick soul (as sins true nature is)
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
</T>

HORATIO
What are they that would speak with me?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Let them come in.
</T>
<T>
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
God bless you, sir.
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Let him bless thee too.
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
He shall, sir, an t please Him. Theres a letter for you, sirit comes from the ambassador that was bound forEnglandif your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is. (gives HORATIO a letter)

HORATIO
(reads)
Horatio,
When thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant, they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them.

CLAUDIUS
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
</T>
<T>
LAERTES
It well appears. But tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So criminal and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirred up.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIUS
Oh, for two special reasons,
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks, and for myself
My virtue or my plague, be it either which
Shes so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him,
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to gracesso that my arrows,
Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aimed them.

GRAVEDIGGER
Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she willfullyseeks her own salvation?
</T>
<T>
OTHER
I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave straight. Thecrowner hath sat on her and finds it Christian burial.
</T>
<T>
GRAVEDIGGER
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her owndefense?
</T>
<T>
OTHER
Why, tis found so.
</T>
<T>
GRAVEDIGGER
It must be se offendendo. It cannot be else. For here liesthe point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act. And anact hath three branchesit is to act, to do, to perform.Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
</T>
<T>
OTHER
Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver
</T>
<T>
GRAVEDIGGER
Give me leave. Here lies the water. Good. Here stands theman. Good. If the man go to this water and drown himself,it is, will he nill he, he goes. Mark you that. But if the watercome to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal,he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his ownlife.
</T>
<T>
OTHER
But is this law?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
So much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.
You do remember all the circumstance?
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
Remember it, my lord?
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly
And praised be rashness for it: let us know
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
When our deep plots do pall, and that should teach us
Theres a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will
</T>
<T>
HORATIO
That is most certain.
</T>
<T>
HAMLET
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them, had my desire,
Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again, making so bold
(My fears forgetting manners) to unseal
Their grand commission, where I found, Horatio
O royal knavery!an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
Withho!such bugs and goblins in my life
That, on the supervise (no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the ax)
My head should be struck off.
