<T>
FLAVIUS
Hence! Home, you idle creatures get you home!
Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
Being mechanical, you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession?Speak, what trade art thou?
</T>
<T>
CARPENTER
Why, sir, a carpenter.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
You, sir, what trade are you?
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as youwould say, a cobbler.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience,which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me. Yet, if you beout, sir, I can mend you.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
What meanst thou by that? Mend me, thou saucyfellow?
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
Why, sir, cobble you.
</T>
<T>
FLAVIUS
Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl. I meddle with notradesmans matters nor womens matters, but withal I amindeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes. When they are in greatdanger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod uponneats leather have gone upon my handiwork.
</T>
<T>
FLAVIUS
But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
</T>
<T>
COBBLER
Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get myself into morework. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar and torejoice in his triumph.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things,
O you hard hearts, you crul men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
</T>
<T>
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompeys blood?
Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
</T>
<T>
FLAVIUS
Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort,
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
</T>
<T>
See whether their basest metal be not moved.
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol.
This way will I. Disrobe the images
If you do find them decked with ceremonies.
</T>
<T>
MURELLUS
May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
</T>
<T>
FLAVIUS
It is no matter. Let no images
Be hung with Caesars trophies. Ill about
And drive away the vulgar from the streets.
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers plucked from Caesars wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Calphurnia!
</T>
<T>
CASCA
Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Calphurnia!
</T>
<T>
CALPHURNIA
Here, my lord.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Stand you directly in Antonius' way
When he doth run his course.Antonius!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Caesar, my lord.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Forget not in your speed, Antonius,
To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say
The barren, touchd in this holy chase,
Shake off their sterile curse.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
I shall remember.
When Caesar says, do this, it is performed.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Set on, and leave no ceremony out.
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
Caesar!
</T>
<T>
CICERO
Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?
Why are you breathless? And why stare you so?
</T>
<T>
CASCA
Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
Th' ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds,
But never till tonight, never till now,
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
Incenses them to send destruction.
</T>
<T>
CICERO
Why, saw you anything more wonderful?
</T>
<T>
CASCA
A common slaveyou know him well by sight
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
Like twenty torches joined, and yet his hand,
Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched.
BesidesI ha' not since put up my sword
Against the Capitol I met a lion,
Who glared upon me and went surly by,
Without annoying me. And there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
Transformd with their fear, who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
What, Lucius, ho!
I cannot by the progress of the stars
Give guess how near to day.Lucius, I say!
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
Called you, my lord?
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
When it is lighted, come and call me here.
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
It must be by his death, and for my part
I know no personal cause to spurn at him
But for the general. He would be crowned.
How that might change his nature, theres the question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
And then I grant we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,
Help, ho! They murder Caesar!Whos within?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
My lord.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success.
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
CALPHURNIA
What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
You shall not stir out of your house today.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me
Ne'er looked but on my back. When they shall see
The face of Caesar, they are vanishd.
</T>
<T>
CALPHURNIA
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
A lioness hath whelpd in the streets,
And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.
</T>
<T>
ARTEMIDORUS
(reads aloud)
Caesar, beware of Brutus. Take heed of Cassius. Come not near Casca. Have an eye to Cinna. Trust not Trebonius. Mark well Metellus Cimber. Decius Brutus loves thee not. Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee!
Thy lover,
Artemidorus
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
And as a suitor will I give him this.
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation.
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live.
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
</T>
<T>
PORTIA
I prithee, boy, run to the senate house.
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
To know my errand, madam.
</T>
<T>
PORTIA
I would have had thee there and here again
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
Set a huge mountain tween my heart and tongue!
I have a mans mind but a womans might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
Art thou here yet?
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?
</T>
<T>
PORTIA
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth. And take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy! What noise is that?
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
I hear none, madam.
</T>
<T>
PORTIA
Prithee, listen well.
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
</T>
<T>
LUCIUS
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
(to the SOOTHSAYER) The ides of March are come.
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.
</T>
<T>
ARTEMIDORUS
(offering his letter) Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
</T>
<T>
DECIUS
(offering CAESAR another paper)
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er-read,
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
</T>
<T>
ARTEMIDORUS
O Caesar, read mine first, for mines a suit
That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
What touches us ourself shall be last served.
</T>
<T>
ARTEMIDORUS
Delay not, Caesar. Read it instantly.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
What, is the fellow mad?
</T>
<T>
PUBLIUS
(to ARTEMIDORUS)Sirrah, give place.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
(to ARTEMIDORUS)
What, urge you your petitions in the street?
Come to the Capitol.
</T>
<T>
PLEBEIANS
We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Then follow me and give me audience, friends.
Cassius, go you into the other street
And part the numbers.
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here.
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him,
And public reasons shall be renderd
Of Caesars death.
</T>
<T>
FIRST PLEBEIAN
I will hear Brutus speak.
</T>
<T>
ANOTHER PLEBEIAN
I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons
When severally we hear them renderd.
</T>
<T>
THIRD PLEBEIAN
The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Be patient till the last.Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause,and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor,and have respect to mine honor that you may believe.Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses thatyou may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly,any dear friend of Caesars, to him I say that Brutus' love toCaesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand whyBrutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that Iloved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
</T>
<T>
CINNA THE POET
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unlucky charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.
</T>
<T>
FIRST PLEBEIAN
What is your name?
</T>
<T>
SECOND PLEBEIAN
Whither are you going?
</T>
<T>
THIRD PLEBEIAN
Where do you dwell?
</T>
<T>
FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
</T>
<T>
SECOND PLEBEIAN
Answer every man directly.
</T>
<T>
FIRST PLEBEIAN
Ay, and briefly.
</T>
<T>
FOURTH PLEBEIAN
Ay, and wisely.
</T>
<T>
THIRD PLEBEIAN
Ay, and truly, you were best.
</T>
<T>
CINNA THE POET
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer everyman directly and briefly, wisely and trulywisely I say, Iam a bachelor.
</T>
<T>
SECOND PLEBEIAN
Thats as much as to say they are fools that marry. Youllbear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed, directly.
</T>
<T>
CINNA THE POET
Directly, I am going to Caesars funeral.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
These many, then, shall die. Their names are pricked.
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIUS
(to LEPIDUS)
Your brother too must die. Consent you, Lepidus?
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
I do consent
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIUS
Prick him down, Antony.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Upon condition Publius shall not live,
Who is your sisters son, Mark Antony.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
He shall not live. Look, with a spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesars house.
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
What, shall I find you here?
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIUS
Or here, or at the Capitol.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
This is a slight, unmeritable man,
Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,
The threefold world divided, he should stand
One of the three to share it?
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Stand, ho!
</T>
<T>
LUCILLIUS
Give the word, ho, and stand.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
What now, Lucillius? Is Cassius near?
</T>
<T>
LUCILLIUS
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
He greets me well.Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change or by ill officers
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done, undone. But if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied.
</T>
<T>
PINDARUS
I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
He is not doubted.A word, Lucillius.
(takes LUCILLIUS aside)
How he received you, let me be resolved.
</T>
<T>
LUCILLIUS
With courtesy and with respect enough.
But not with such familiar instances
Nor with such free and friendly conference
As he hath used of old.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucillius,
When love begins to sicken and decay,
It useth an enforcd ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
That you have wronged me doth appear in this:
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,
Wherein my letters, praying on his side
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm,
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
I an itching palm!
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
Chastisement!
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Remember March, the ides of March remember.
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIUS
Now, Antony, our hopes are answerd.
You said the enemy would not come down
But keep the hills and upper regions.
It proves not so. Their battles are at hand.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
Answering before we do demand of them.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
Wherefore they do it. They could be content
To visit other places, and come down
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage.
But tis not so.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Prepare you, generals.
The enemy comes on in gallant show.
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
And something to be done immediately.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
Upon the left hand of the even field.
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIUS
Upon the right hand I. Keep thou the left.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Why do you cross me in this exigent?
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side.
</T>
<T>
Let them set on at once, for I perceive
But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
Myself have to mine own turned enemy.
This ensign here of mine was turning back.
I slew the coward and did take it from him.
(indicates his standard)
</T>
<T>
TITINIUS
O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
</T>
<T>
PINDARUS
Fly further off, my lord, fly further off.
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord.
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
This hill is far enough.Look, look, Titinius.
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
</T>
<T>
TITINIUS
They are, my lord.
</T>
<T>
CASSIUS
Titinius, if thou lovest me,
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again, that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
</T>
<T>
CATO
What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
I will proclaim my name about the field.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
A foe to tyrants, and my countrys friend.
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
</T>
<T>
LUCILLIUS
And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I!
Brutus, my countrys friend. Know me for Brutus!
</T>
<T>
O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,
And mayst be honored, being Catos son.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
(to LUCILLIUS) Yield, or thou diest.
</T>
<T>
LUCILLIUS
Only I yield to die.
There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight.
Kill Brutus, and be honored in his death.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
We must not. A noble prisoner!
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
</T>
<T>
CLITUS
Statilius showed the torchlight but, my lord,
He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word.
It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
(whispers to CLITUS)
</T>
<T>
CLITUS
What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Peace then! No words.
</T>
<T>
CLITUS
Ill rather kill myself.
</T>
<T>
BRUTUS
Hark thee, Dardanius.
(whispers to DARDANIUS)
</T>
<T>
DARDANIUS
Shall I do such a deed?
</T>
<T>
CLITUS
O Dardanius!
</T>
<T>
DARDANIUS
O Clitus!
</T>
<T>
CLITUS
(aside to DARDANIUS)
What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
</T>
<T>
DARDANIUS
(aside to CLITUS)
To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
</T>
