RICHARD
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this son of York,
And all the clouds that loured upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
Our bruisd arms hung up for monuments,
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smoothed his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barbd steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking glass;
I, that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
I, that am curtailed of this fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinished, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to see my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity.
</T>
<T>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determind to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate, the one against the other;
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mewed up
About a prophecy which says that G
Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be.
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.
</T>
<T>
Brother, good day. What means this armd guard
That waits upon your Grace?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
His majesty,
Tend'ring my persons safety, hath appointed
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Upon what cause?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Because my name is George.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
O, belike his majesty hath some intent
That you shall be new christened in the Tower.
But whats the matter, Clarence? May I know?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Yea, Richard, when I know, for I protest
As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
And from the crossrow plucks the letter G,
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be.
And for my name of George begins with G,
It follows in his thought that I am he.
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
Have moved his Highness to commit me now.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Why, this it is when men are ruled by women.
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower.
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, tis she
That tempers him to this extremity.
Was it not she and that good man of worship,
Anthony Woodeville, her brother there,
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
From whence this present day he is delivered?
We are not safe, Clarence. We are not safe.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
But the queens kindred and night-walking heralds
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
Ill tell you what: I think it is our way,
If we will keep in favor with the king,
To be her men and wear her livery.
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
Since that our brother dubbed them gentlewomen,
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
I beseech your Graces both to pardon me.
His majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference,
Of what degree soever, with his brother.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Even so. An please your Worship, Brakenbury,
You may partake of anything we say.
We speak no treason, man. We say the king
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue,
And that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks.
How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
Were best he do it secretly, alone.
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
What one, my lord?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
We are the queens abjects and must obey.
Brother, farewell. I will unto the king,
And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,
Were it to call King Edwards widow sister,
I will perform it to enfranchise you.
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long.
I will deliver you or else lie for you.
Meantime, have patience.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
I must perforce. Farewell.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
If heaven will take the present at our hands.
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Good time of day unto my gracious lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain.
Well are you welcome to the open air.
How hath your lordship brooked imprisonment?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must.
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too,
For they that were your enemies are his
And have prevailed as much on him as you.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
More pity that the eagle should be mewed
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
What news abroad?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
No news so bad abroad as this at home:
The king is sickly, weak and melancholy,
And his physicians fear him mightily.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Now, by Saint Paul, that news is bad indeed.
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
And overmuch consumed his royal person.
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
Where is he, in his bed?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
He is.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Go you before, and I will follow you.
</T>
<T>
He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
Till George be packed with post-horse up to heaven.
Ill in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
With lies well steeled with weighty arguments,
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
Clarence hath not another day to live;
Which done, God take King Edward to His mercy,
And leave the world for me to bustle in.
For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter.
What though I killed her husband and her father?
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father;
The which will I, not all so much for love
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto.
But yet I run before my horse to market.
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns.
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
</T>
<T>
ANNE
Set down, set down your honorable load,
If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
</T>
<T>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
Stabbed by the selfsame hand that made these wounds.
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
O, cursd be the hand that made these holes;
Cursd the heart that had the heart to do it;
Cursd the blood that let this blood from hence.
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
That makes us wretched by the death of thee
Than I can wish to wolves, to spiders, toads,
Or any creeping venomed thing that lives.
If ever he have child, abortive be it,
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
And that be heir to his unhappiness.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Have patience, madam. Theres no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustomed health.
</T>
<T>
GREY
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse.
Therefore, for Gods sake, entertain good comfort
And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
If he were dead, what would betide on me?
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
No other harm but loss of such a lord.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
The loss of such a lord includes all harms.
</T>
<T>
GREY
The heavens have blessed you with a goodly son
To be your comforter when he is gone.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah, he is young, and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me nor none of you.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Is it concluded that he shall be Protector?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
It is determined, not concluded yet;
But so it must be if the king miscarry.
</T>
<T>
KEEPER
Why looks your grace so heavily today?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
O, I have passed a miserable night,
So full of ugly dreams, of ugly sights,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night
Though twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time.
</T>
<T>
KEEPER
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,
And in my company my brother Gloucester,
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward England
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
What sights of ugly death within my eyes.
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks,
A thousand men that fishes gnawed upon,
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
</T>
<T>
KING EDWARD IV
Why, so. Now have I done a good days work.
You peers, continue this united league.
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence,
And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven
Since I have made my friends at peace on earth
Rivers and Hastings, take each others hand.
Dissemble not your hatred. Swear your love.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
(taking HASTINGSs hand) By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,
And with my hand I seal my true hearts love.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
So thrive I as I truly swear the like.
</T>
<T>
KING EDWARD IV
Take heed you dally not before your king,
Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the others end.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
So prosper I as I swear perfect love.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
And I as I love Hastings with my heart.
</T>
<T>
BOY
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
No, boy.
</T>
<T>
GIRL
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
And cry, O Clarence, my unhappy son?
</T>
<T>
BOY
Why do you look on us and shake your head,
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
If that our noble father were alive?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.
I do lament the sickness of the king,
As loath to lose him, not your fathers death.
It were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost.
</T>
<T>
BOY
Then, you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
The king mine uncle is to blame for it.
God will revenge it, whom I will importune
With earnest prayers, all to that effect.
</T>
<T>
GIRL
And so will I.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Peace, children, peace. The king doth love you well.
Incapable and shallow innocents,
You cannot guess who caused your fathers death.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
I promise you I scarcely know myself.
Hear you the news abroad?
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Yes, that the king is dead.
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
Ill news, by 'r Lady. Seldom comes the better.
I fear, I fear, twill prove a giddy world.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Neighbors, God speed.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Give you good morrow, sir.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Doth this news hold of good King Edwards death?
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
No, no, by Gods good grace, his son shall reign.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Woe to the land thats governed by a child.
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
In him there is a hope of government,
Which, in his nonage, council under him,
And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
And at Northampton they do rest tonight.
Tomorrow or next day they will be here.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
I long with all my heart to see the prince.
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
But I hear no; they say my son of York
Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
</T>
<T>
YORK
Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Why, my young cousin? It is good to grow.
</T>
<T>
YORK
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talked how I did grow
More than my brother: Ay, quoth my uncle Gloucester,
Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace.
And since, methinks I would not grow so fast
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee!
He was the wretchedst thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
</T>
<T>
YORK
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
(to PRINCE) Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
The weary way hath made you melancholy.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE
No, uncle, but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
I want more uncles here to welcome me.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
Hath not yet dived into the worlds deceit;
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show, which, God He knows,
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.
Your Grace attended to their sugared words
But looked not on the poison of their hearts.
God keep you from them, and from such false friends.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE
God keep me from false friends, but they were none.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
(knocking) My lord, my lord.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
(within) Who knocks?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
One from the Lord Stanley.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
(within) What is t oclock?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Upon the stroke of four.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
So it appears by that I have to say.
First, he commends him to your noble self.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
What then?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Then certifies your Lordship that this night
He dreamt the boar had razd his helm
Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
And that may be determined at the one
Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
Therefore he sends to know your Lordships pleasure,
If you will presently take horse with him
And with all speed post with him toward the north
To shun the danger that his soul divines.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this:
Today shalt thou behold a subject die
For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
</T>
<T>
GREY
(to RATCLIFFE)
God bless the prince from all the pack of you!
A knot you are of damnd bloodsuckers.
</T>
<T>
VAUGHAN
(to RATCLIFFE) You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
</T>
<T>
RATCLIFFE
Dispatch. The limit of your lives is out.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
Within the guilty closure of thy walls,
Richard the Second here was hacked to death,
And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
</T>
<T>
GREY
Now Margarets curse is fall'n upon our heads,
When she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I,
For standing by when Richard stabbed her son.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Then cursed she Richard, then cursed she Buckingham.
Then cursed she Hastings. O, remember, God,
To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
And for my sister and her princely sons,
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
Which, as thou knowst, unjustly must be spilt.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Now, noble peers. the cause why we are met
Is to determine of the coronation.
In Gods name, speak. When is the royal day?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Is all things ready for the royal time?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
It is, and wants but nomination.
</T>
<T>
ELY
Tomorrow, then, I judge a happy day.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Who knows the Lord Protectors mind herein?
Who is most inward with the noble duke?
</T>
<T>
ELY
Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
We know each others faces; for our hearts,
He knows no more of mine than I of yours,
Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
I thank his Grace. I know he loves me well.
But for his purpose in the coronation,
I have not sounded him, nor he delivered
His gracious pleasure any way therein.
But you, my honorable lords, may name the time,
And in the dukes behalf Ill give my voice,
Which I presume hell take in gentle part.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy color,
Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
And then begin again, and stop again,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,
Speak, and look back, and pry on every side,
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
Are at my service, like enforcd smiles,
And both are ready in their offices,
At any time to grace my stratagems.
But what, is Catesby gone?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
He is; and see, he brings the mayor along.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Lord Mayor
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Look to the drawbridge there!
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Hark, a drum!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
</T>
<T>
SCRIVENER
This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings,
Which in a set hand fairly is engrossed,
That it may be today read o'er in Pauls.
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
The precedent was full as long a-doing,
And yet within these five hours Hastings lived,
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty.
Heres a good world the while. Who is so gross
That cannot see this palpable device?
Yet who so bold but says he sees it not?
Bad is the world, and all will come to naught
When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
How now, how now? What say the citizens?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
The citizens are mum, say not a word.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Touched you the bastardy of Edwards children?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy
And his contract by deputy in France;
Th' unsatiate greediness of his desire
And his enforcement of the city wives;
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
As being got, your father then in France,
His resemblance being not like the duke.
Withal, I did infer your lineaments,
Being the right idea of your father,
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
Untouched or slightly handled in discourse.
And when mine oratory grew toward end,
I bid them that did love their countrys good
Cry God save Richard, Englands royal king!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
And did they so?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
Now, for my life, shes wandering to the Tower,
On pure hearts love, to greet the tender prince.
Daughter, well met.
</T>
<T>
ANNE
God give your Graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
As much to you, good sister. Whither away?
</T>
<T>
ANNE
No farther than the Tower, and, as I guess,
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
To gratulate the gentle princes there.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Kind sister, thanks. Well enter all together.
</T>
<T>
And in good time here the lieutenant comes.
Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
How doth the prince and my young son of York?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
I may not suffer you to visit them.
The king hath strictly charged the contrary.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
My gracious sovereign.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Give me thy hand.
</T>
<T>
Thus high, by thy advice
And thy assistance is King Richard seated.
But shall we wear these glories for a day,
Or shall they last and we rejoice in them?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Still live they, and forever let them last.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
To try if thou be current gold indeed.
Young Edward lives; think now what I would speak.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Say on, my loving lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king,
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Why so you are, my thrice-renownd lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Ha! Am I king? 'Tis sobut Edward lives.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
True, noble prince.
</T>
<T>
TYRREL
The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
The most arch deed of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
Albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
O thus quoth Dighton, lay those gentle babes.
Thus, thus, quoth Forrest, girdling one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms.
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
And in their summer beauty kissed each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay,
Which once, quoth Forrest, almost changed my mind,
But O, the devilThere the villain stopped;
When Dighton thus told on: We smotherd
The most replenishd sweet work of nature
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.
Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse;
They could not speak; and so I left them both
To bear this tidings to the bloody king.
</T>
<T>
And here he comes.All health, my sovereign lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
So now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
Here in these confines slyly have I lurked
To watch the waning of mine enemies.
A dire induction am I witness to,
And will to France, hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes,
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets,
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
And be not fixed in doom perpetual,
Hover about me with your airy wings
And hear your mothers lamentation.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
Hover about her; say that right for right
Hath dimmed your infant morn to agd night.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
So many miseries have crazed my voice
That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
(aside) Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet;
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of the most deadly boar
My son George Stanley is franked up in hold;
If I revolt, off goes young Georges head;
The fear of that holds off my present aid.
So get three gone. Commend me to thy lord.
Withal, say that the queen hath heartily consented
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
</T>
<T>
CHRISTOPHER
At Pembroke, or at Ha'rfordwest in Wales.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
What men of name resort to him?
</T>
<T>
CHRISTOPHER
Sir Walter Herbert, a renownd soldier;
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew,
And many other of great name and worth;
And towards London they do bend their power,
If by the way they be not fought withal.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
(gives him a paper) Well, hie thee to thy lord.
I kiss his hand. My letter will resolve him of my mind.
Farewell.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
</T>
<T>
SHERIFF
No, my good lord. Therefore be patient.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Hastings and Edwards children, Grey and Rivers,
Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward,
Vaughan, and all that have miscarrid
By underhand, corrupted, foul injustice,
If that your moody, discontented souls
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
Even for revenge mock my destruction.
This is All Souls' Day, fellow, is it not?
</T>
<T>
SHERIFF
It is.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Why, then All Souls' Day is my bodys doomsday.
This is the day which, in King Edwards time,
I wished might fall on me when I was found
False to his children and his wifes allies.
This is the day wherein I wished to fall
By the false faith of him who most I trusted.
This, this All Souls' Day to my fearful soul
Is the determined respite of my wrongs.
That high All-seer which I dallied with
Hath turned my feignd prayer on my head
And given in earnest what I begged in jest.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Have we marched on without impediment,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
In your embowelled bosomsthis foul swine
Is now even in the center of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
From Tamworth thither is but one days march.
In Gods name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
</T>
<T>
OXFORD
Every mans conscience is a thousand men,
To fight against this guilty homicide.
</T>
<T>
HERBERT
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
</T>
<T>
BLUNT
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
All for our vantage. Then, in Gods name, march.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallows wings.
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
</T>
<T>
SURREY
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
My Lord of Norfolk
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
Here, most gracious liege.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Norfolk, we must have knocks, ha, must we not?
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
We must both give and take, my loving lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Up with my tent!Here will I lie tonight.
But where tomorrow? Well, alls one for that.
Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Why, our battalia trebles that account.
Besides, the kings name is a tower of strength
Which they upon the adverse party want.
Up with the tent!Come, noble gentlemen,
Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
Call for some men of sound direction.
Lets lack no discipline, make no delay,
For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.
</T>
<T>
CATESBY
Rescue, my lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger.
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
</T>
<T>
CATESBY
Withdraw, my lord. Ill help you to a horse.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die.
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain today instead of him.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
God and your arms be praised, victorious friends!
The day is ours; the bloody dog is dead.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
(offering him the crown)
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
Lo, here this long-usurpd royalty
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Have I plucked off, to grace thy brows withal.
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Great God of heaven, say amen to all!
But tell me, is young George Stanley living?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
What men of name are slain on either side?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers,
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us.
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
We will unite the white rose and the red.
</T>
