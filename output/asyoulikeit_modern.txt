ORLANDO
I remember, Adam, thats exactlyThe actual reason is never made clear; the audience has happened upon a conversation already in progress.exactly why my father only left me a thousand crowns in his will. And as you know, my father commanded my brother, Oliver, to make sure that I was brought up welland thats where my sadness begins. Oliver keeps my brother Jaques away at school, and everyone says hes doing extremely well there. But he keeps me at home in the countryto be precise, he keeps me stuck at home but doesnt support me. I ask you, is this any way to treat a gentleman as nobly born as I am, to pen me in like an ox? His horses get treated better than I doat least he feeds them and trains them properly, and spends a lot of money on trainers for them. All Ive gained from his care is weight, which makes me as indebted to him as his animals on the manure pile are. He gives me plenty of nothing, and takes away everything else, letting me eat with his servants, refusing me whats owed me as his brother, and ruining my good birth with a poor education. This is what angers me, Adam. My fathers temper and spirit, which I think I share, makes me want to mutiny against my brothers tyranny. I wont stand for it any longer, though I havent yet figured out how to revolt.
</T>
<T>
ADAM
Here comes my master, your brother.
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Go hide, Adam, and youll hear how he abuses me.
</T>

OLIVER
Hey, you! What are you makingOliver means what are you doing here, but Orlando interprets making in its usual sense.making here?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Nothing. Ive never been taught how to make anything.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Well, then, what are you messing up?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Im helping you mess up one of Gods creationsyour poor, unworthy brotherby having him do nothing.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Indeed, sir, find something better to do and get lost for a while.
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them? When did I wasteOrlando alludes to the prodigal son, a figure from the Bible who leaves home, spends all his money, and returns to his fathers house in poverty (Luke 15).waste so much money that I ended up this poor?
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Do you know where you are, sir?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Yes, sir, very wellIm here in your orchard.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Do you know whom youre talking to?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Yes, better than you know me. I know youre my oldest brother, and deserve more respect. But were in the same family, so you should acknowledge that I am a gentleman too. According to custom, as the first-born you are my superior. But its not customary to treat me like Im not even a gentleman, even if there were twenty brothers between you and me. I have as much of our father in me as you do, though I admit youre closer to him and matter more because youre older.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
(hitting ORLANDO) What nerve!
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
(grabbing hold of OLIVER) Come on, big brother; you dont know anything about fighting.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
What, you dare put your hands on me, villain?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Im no villain. Im the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, and anyone who claims my fathers sons are villains is a villain himself. If you werent my brother, Id leave this hand of mine on your neck until Id pulled out your tongue for talking like this. Youve only insulted yourself.
</T>
<T>
ADAM
Gentlemen, calm down. For the sake of your fathers memory, make peace.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Let me go, I say.
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
I wont until Im ready. You will listen to me. My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education. But youve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman. My fathers spirit is growing in me, and I wont take this any longer. Either give me the freedom to act like someone of my own rank or give me my share of the inheritance, so that I can seek my fortune elsewhere.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
And what are you going to do after youve spent your money? Beg? Well, sir, go inside. Im not going to be bothered by you for long. Youll get some of what you want. Now please leave me alone.
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
I wont bother you any more than necessary.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
(to ADAM) And you get lost too, you old dog.
</T>
<T>
ADAM
Is that my rewardto be called old dog? Well, its true, Ive served this family so long Ive gotten old and toothless, like a dog. God bless my old master. He would never have spoken to me like this.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Is that how its going to be? Are you starting to challenge me? Ill cure you of your insolence, and Im not going to give you a thousand crowns, either!Hey, Dennis!
</T>
<T>
DENNIS
Did you call for me, your Worship?
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Wasnt Charles, the dukes wrestler, here to speak with me?
</T>
<T>
DENNIS
Yes, sir, hes here at the door right now and asks to see you.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Call him in.
</T>
<T>
I have a good plan. And tomorrow is the wrestling match.
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
Good morning, sir.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Good Mr. Charles! Tell me, whats the latest news at the new court?
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
No news but the old news: the old Duke Senior has been banished by his younger brother, the new Duke Frederick. A few loyal lords have gone into exile with Duke Senior, and given up their lands and money to Frederickso hes happy enough to have them leave.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Seniors daughter, has also been banished?
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
Oh, no. Duke Fredericks daughter, Celia, grew up with Rosalind, and Celia loves her cousin so much that she would have either followed her into exile or died of grief. Rosalind has stayed at court, where Duke Frederick loves her like his own daughter. No two women ever loved each other like they do.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Where will the old duke live?
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
They say hes already in the Forest of Arden. He has many cheerful men with him, and they live like Robin Hood and his outlaws. People say that new batches of young men flock there every day, and that they all pass the time without a care, like people did in the Golden AgeIn Greek mythology, the first humans lived in a Golden Age, free from work, conflict, or violence, and without the need of laws.Golden Age.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
So, are you going to wrestle before the new duke tomorrow?
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
Indeed I do, sir, and Ive come to let you in on a certain problem. Ive been informed by certain sources I cant disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise. Tomorrow, sir, Im fighting for my reputation, and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed. Your brother is young and inexperienced, and because of my affection for you, Id hate to crush himthough Id have to, if he challenged me. Im telling you all this out of affection for you, so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace, which will be his own fault, not mine.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Charles, I thank you for your loyalty to me, and youll see that Ill reward you. Id heard about my brothers plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind, but hes determined. I tell you, Charles, hes the stubbornest young fellow in France: overly ambitious, jealous of other peoples good qualities, and a traitor against me, his own blood brother. So use your discretion. Id be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger. And youd better be careful, because if you embarrass him at allin fact, if he doesnt beat you thoroughlyhell come after you and wont leave you alone till hes poisoned you or trapped youkilled you, in other words, one way or another. It brings me to tears to say this, but there isnt another person alive who is so young and at the same time so wicked. Because hes my brother, I have to take his side. But if I really laid him bare, Id have to weep and hang my head, and you would not believe me, his behavior is so shocking.
</T>
<T>
CHARLES
Im very glad I came to see you. If he shows up tomorrow, Ill give him whats coming to him. If he can manage to walk after our fight, Ill never wrestle for money again. Farewell, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OLIVER
Take care, Charles.
</T>
<T>
Now its time to get this playboy brother of mine all worked up. I hope Ill see the end of him soonI dont know why, but I hate nothing in the world as much as him, though hes an upstanding guy. Hes never gone to school but hes smart, with good values, and everyone is delighted by him and loves him, especially my subjects, who know him the best. They love him, and therefore they despise me. But not for long; Charles will take care of everything. All I have to do is get Orlando to fight, which Ill do now.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Please, Rosalind, my sweet cousinbe happy.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
Dear CeliaI already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier? Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father, you shouldnt try to teach me how to be happy.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Well, by this I can see that you dont love me as much as I love you. If your father had banished my father, I could have learned to love your father as my own, as long as I still had you. Youd do the same, if your love for me were as true as mine for you.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
Well, Ill just forget the difficulties of my situation, in order to focus on the happiness of yours.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
You know Im my fathers only child, and he isnt likely to have another. And when he dies, you will inherit his fortunebecause whatever he took from your father by force, I will return to you as affection. I swear I will, and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster. So please, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be happy.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
From now on I will, cousin, and Ill think of all kinds of games for us. Let me seewhat do you think about falling in love?
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Yes, please do, so we can have a good laugh about it. But dont fall in love for real, and dont take the game too far. You want to get out of it easily, and with your honor intact.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Whats going on, Rosalind? Cupid have mercy! You wont utter a single word?
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
I dont even have one to throw at a dog.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
No, your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs. Throw some of your words at me. Come on, throw your words at me like you would throw stones at a dog.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed: one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Is all of this about your father?
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
No, some of it is about my childs father. Oh, this working-dayWorking-day=wearisome.working-day world is full of thorns!
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Theyre only burrs, cousin, thrown at you because you took a holiday from conventional behavior. If we walk on the well-worn paths, they wont get caught in our petticoats.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
Those burrs I could shake off my clothing, but these are in my heart.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Cough them up.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
Id try it, if I could cry hem and have him.
</T>
<T>
CELIA
Come on, take control of your feelings.

DUKE SENIOR
Now, my companions and brothers in exile, hasnt experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance? Arent these woods less perilous than the court, with all its jealousies and intrigues? Out here we feel the changing of the seasons, but were not bothered by it. When the icy fangs of the brutal, scolding wind bite and blow on my body, even though Im shivering with cold, I can appreciate the weathers honesty. I smile and think, Thank goodness the wind doesnt flatter me: its like a councilor who makes me feel what Im really made of. Adversity can have its benefitslike the ugly, poisonous toadToads were thought to be poisonous, and to each have a jewel embedded in its forehead.toad that wears a precious jewel in its forehead. In this life, far away from the civilized world, we can hear the language of the trees, read the books of the running streams, hear sermons in the stones, and discover the good in every single thing.

Come, shall we hunt some deer for dinner? It bothers me, though, that these poor spotted innocents, who, after all, are this deserted citys native citizens, should be gouged with arrows.

DUKE FREDERICK
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave? It cannot be. Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen.

My lord, that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing. Hisperia, the princesss gentlewoman, confesses that she overheard your daughter and her cousin praising the good looks and skills of the wrestler who recently beat the muscular Charles. Hisperia believes that, wherever they have gone, that young man is likely with them.
</T>
<T>
DUKE FREDERICK
Send a message to his brother. Bring that swinger Orlando here. If hes not around, bring his brother Oliver to me. Ill make Oliver find him. Do this immediately, and dont stop searching and interrogating until youve brought home these foolish runaways.

ORLANDO
Whos there?

ADAM
My young master! Oh, my gentle master! My sweet master! Oh, you living memory of old Sir Rowland! What are you doing here? Why are you so strong and good? Why do people love you? And why are you noble, strong, and brave? Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody dukes favorite champion? Your praise has beaten you home. Dont you know, master, that some mens best qualities do them in? Yours are like thatcomplete and utter traitors to you. Oh, what a world this is, when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him!
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
Why, whats the matter?

ADAM
Oh, unlucky boy! Dont walk through these doors. In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you. Oliver, your brotherno, not your brother; and yet hes the sonbut no, I wont call him the sonof that great man I was about to call his father, has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match, and tonight hes planning on burning your house down, with you in it. And if he fails at that, he will find other ways to kill you. I overheard him and his plans. This is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse. Hate it, fear it, do not come inside.

Hey, whats this, Adam? No braver than this? Live a little, be comforted a little, cheer up a little. If I can find any animal in this wild forest, Ill either be food for it or bring it as food for you. Youre not as close to death as you think you are. For my sake, make yourself comfortable; keep death at arms length for a while. Ill be back soon, and if I havent brought you anything to eat, I will give you permission to die. But if you die before I return, youll have made a mockery of my efforts. There we go! You look happier already, and Ill be back quickly. But youre lying out in the cold. Come, Ill carry you to shelter. And you wont die for lack of dinner, if theres anything at all to eat in this desert-like forest. Cheer up, good Adam.

And how are you liking the shepherds life, Master Touchstone?
</T>
<T>
TOUCHSTONE
Well, in and of itself, it is a good life, but given that its a shepherds life, its worthless. In the fact that its solitary, I enjoy it very much; but in the sense that its private, its terrible. Now, Im very pleased with it being outdoors, but in its not being at the court, it is boring. Being a simple life, it suits me very well, but being a life without plenty, it doesnt suit me at all. Are you any kind of philosopher yourself, shepherd?

</T>
<T>
AUDREY
I dont know what poetical means. Is it chaste in word and action? Does it mean being truthful?
</T>
<T>
TOUCHSTONE
Not really, for the truest poetry is often the most artificial. Lovers are fond of poetry and often concoct great lies in their poems.
</T>
<T>
AUDREY
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical?

I dont want to be your executioner: Im trying to avoid you so that I wont hurt you. You tell me my eyes are murderousthats a very pretty sentiment, and oh-so-probable, that my frail, soft eyes (which are so cowardly that they close their gates against dust) are tyrants, butchers, and murderers. Im frowning at you with all my might right now. If my eyes can injure, let them kill you now. Go ahead. Faint, fall downif you dont, then youre lying about my eyes being murderers. Come on, show me the wound that my eyes have caused. If you get scratched with a pin, it leaves a scar; even if you lean on a rush, it leaves an impression on your palm. But my eyes, which Ive darted at you, havent even left a mark. Now I am sure that eyes cant hurt a person.

ROSALIND
In that case its good to be a post.

JAQUES
Im not a scholars kind of melancholy, which is all about impressing ones peers, or a musicians, which comes from his passion for his art. I dont have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer. My melancholy is not like a ladyswhich is nothing more than an affectationnor like a lovers, which combines all of these qualities. My melancholy is purely my owna compound made from many ingredients. Im serious because Ive traveled so much. When I think about all the things Ive seen, I sink into deep thoughts.

Dont be ashamed to wear the horns.
Theyve been worn since before you were born.
Your fathers father wore it,
And your father endured it.
The horn, the horn, the lustful horn

Dont question the foolish haste of it allor her poverty or our short time together or the abruptness of my courtship or the abruptness of her consentbut say with me, I love Aliena. And say with me that she loves me. Agree to this match, so we can enjoy each other. It will be to your advantage, because Ill leave our fathers house and all his property to you, while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest.

ORLANDO

</T>
<T>
FIRST PAGE
Should we just get down to it? Should we skip all that hacking and spitting and saying that were hoarse, which only makes clear what lousy singers we are?
</T>
<T>
SECOND PAGE
Yes, yes, and lets sing in unison, like two gypsies riding on a single horse.
</T>

PAGES
(singing)
There was a lover and his girl,
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey-nonny-no,
Who walked through the cornfield
In the springtime, the only proper wedding time,
The time when birds sing, Hey ding-a-ding-ding.
Sweet lovers love the spring.
Between the acres of rye,

DUKE SENIOR

ORLANDO
Sometimes I do and sometimes I dont. Im afraid of hoping, but I hope anyway.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
(as Ganymede) Be patient for a bit longer while I go over the terms of our agreement. (to DUKE SENIOR) You say that if I bring Rosalind here, you will give her to Orlando in marriage?
</T>
<T>
DUKE SENIOR
Yes, even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
(to ORLANDO) And you promise to marry her, when I bring her here?
</T>
<T>
ORLANDO
I will, even if I were king of all kingdoms.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
(to PHOEBE) And you say youll marry me, if Im willing to marry you?
</T>
<T>
PHOEBE
Yes, even if I die an hour later.
</T>
<T>
ROSALIND
But if you decide not to marry me, youll marry this faithful shepherd instead?
