<T>
RODERIGO
Tush! Never tell me. I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
'Sblood, but youll not hear me! If ever Idid dream of such a matter, abhor me.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Thou toldst me
Thou didst hold him in thy hate.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Despise me
If I do not. Three great ones of the city
(In personal suit to make me his lieutenant)
Off-capped to him, and by the faith of man
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.
But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)
Evades them with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuffed with epithets of war,
And in conclusion
Nonsuits my mediators. For Certes, sayshe,
I have already chose my officer.
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine
(A fellow almost damned in a fair wife)
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinsterunless the bookish theoric,
</T>
<T>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th' election
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be beleed and calmed
By debitor and creditor. This counter-caster
He (in good time) must his lieutenant be
And I, bless the mark, his Moorships ancient.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Why, theres no remedy. 'Tis the curse ofservice.
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to th' first. Now sir, be judge yourself,
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I would not follow him then.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
O sir, content you.
I follow him to serve my turn upon him.
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly followed. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave
That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)
Wears out his time much like his masters ass
For naught but provender, and when hes old, cashiered.
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them. And when they have lined their coats,
Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,
</T>
<T>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.
In following him, I follow but myself.
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end.
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at. I am not what I am.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What a full fortune does the Thick-lips owe
If he can carryt thus!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Call up herfather.
Rouse him. Make after him, Poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets. Incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy
Yet throw such changes of vexation ont,
As it may lose some color.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Here is her fathers house, Ill call aloud.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Awake! What, ho, Brabantio! Thieves! Thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!
Thieves! thieves!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
What is the reason of this terrible summons?
What is the matter there?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Signior, is all your family within?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Are your doors locked?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Why, wherefore askyou this?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Zounds, sir, youre robbed! For shame, put on yourgown.
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul.
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.
Arise, I say!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
What, have youlost your wits?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Not I. What are you?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
My name is Roderigo.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
The worser welcome.
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,
Being full of supper and distempering drafts,
Upon malicious knavery dost thou come
To start my quiet?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Sir, sir, sir
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
But thou must needs be sure
My spirits and my place have in their power
To make this bitter to thee.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Patience, goodsir.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
What tellst thou me of robbing? This is Venice,
My house is not a grange.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Most graveBrabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if thedevil bid you. Because we come to do you service and you think weare ruffians, youll have your daughter covered with aBarbary horse. Youll have your nephews neigh to you.Youll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
What profane wretch art thou?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Thou art a villain!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
You are a senator!
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
Ift be your pleasure and most wise consent
(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter
At this odd-even and dull watch o' th' night
</T>
<T>
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor,
If this be known to you and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.
But if you know not this my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.
Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)
I say again, hath made a gross revolt,
Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Strike on thetinder, ho!
Give me a taper, call up all my people!
This accident is not unlike my dream,
Belief of it oppresses me already.
Light, I say, light!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(to RODERIGO)
Farewell, for Imust leave you.
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)
Against the Moor. For I do know the state
(However this may gall him with some check)
Cannot with safety cast him, for hes embarked
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
(Which even now stand in act) that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business. In which regard,
</T>
<T>
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,
Yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
(Which is indeed but sign). That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raisd search,
And there will I be with him. So farewell.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
It is too true an evil. Gone she is.
And whats to come of my despisd time
Is naught but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
Where didst thou see her?Oh, unhappy girl!
With the Moor, sayst thou?Who would be afather?
How didst thou know twas she?Oh, shedeceives me
Past thought!What said she to you?Get moretapers,
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Truly, I think they are.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Oh, heaven, how got she out? Oh, treason of the blood!
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
By what you see them act. Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
Of some such thing?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Yes, sir, I haveindeed.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Call up my brotherOh, would you had had her!
Some one way, some another. Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I think I can discover him, if you please
To get good guard and go along with me.
</T>
<T>
BRABANTIO
Pray you lead on. At every house Ill call.
I may command at most.Get weapons, ho!
And raise some special officers of might.
On, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' th'conscience
To do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times
I had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
'Tis better as it is.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Nay, but he prated
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honor
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married? Be assured of this:
That the Magnifico is much beloved
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the Dukes. He will divorce you,
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law (with all his might to enforce it on)
Will give him cable.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Let him do hisspite.
My services which I have done the signiory
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet toknow
Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reached. For know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
I would not my unhousd free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the seas worth. But look, what lights come yond?
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Theres no composition in this news
That gives them credit.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SENATOR
Indeed, they are disproportioned.
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
And mine a hundred and forty.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SENATOR
And mine, twohundred.
But though they jump not on a just account
As in these cases, where the aim reports
'Tis oft with differenceyet do they allconfirm
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment.
I do not so secure me in the error,
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense.
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
(within)
What, ho, what,ho, what, ho!
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
A messenger from the galleys.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Now, whats the business?
</T>
<T>
SAILOR
The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes,
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
What from the cape can you discern at sea?
</T>
<T>
FIRST GENTLEMAN
Nothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.
I cannot twixt the heaven and the main
Descry a sail.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land,
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
If it hath ruffianed so upon the sea
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
</T>
<T>
SECOND GENTLEMAN
A segregation of the Turkish fleet.
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
Seems to cast water on the burning bear,
And quench the guards of th' ever-fixdpole.
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafd flood.
</T>
<T>
MONTANO
If that the Turkish fleet
Be not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.
It is impossible they bear it out.
</T>
<T>
HERALD
It is Othellos pleasure, our noble and valiantgeneral, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, importing the mereperdition of the Turkish fleet, every man put himself into triumph:some to dance, some to make bonfires, each man to what sport andrevels his addiction leads him. For besides these beneficial news,it is the celebration of his nuptial. So much was his pleasureshould be proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is fullliberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bellhave told eleven. Bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble generalOthello!
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Good Michael, look you to the guard tonight.
Lets teach ourselves that honorable stop
Not to outsport discretion.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Iago hath direction what to do,
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
Will I look to t.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Iago is mosthonest.
Michael, good night. Tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you.
Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue:
That profits yet to come tween me and you.
Good night.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Welcome, Iago. We must to the watch.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Not this hour, lieutenant, tis not yet teno' the clock. Our general cast us thus early for the loveof his Desdemonawho let us not therefore blame. He hathnot yet made wanton the night with her, and she is sport for Jove.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Shes a most exquisite lady.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
And, Ill warrant her, full of game.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Masters, play here, I will content your pains.
Something thats brief, and bid Goodmorrow, general.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speaki' th' nose thus?
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
How, sir? How?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Ay, marry, are they, sir.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Oh, thereby hangs a tail.
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Marry sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters,heres money for you, and the general so likes your musicthat he desires you, for loves sake, to make no morenoise with it.
</T>
<T>
MUSICIAN
Well, sir, we will not.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
And by him do my duties to the senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works,
Repair there to me.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Well, my good lord, Ill do t.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see t?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMEN
Well wait upon your lordship.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the cause were his.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Oh, thats an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
Hes never anything but your true servant.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I know t, I thank you. You do love my lord.
You have known him long, and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a polite distance.
</T>
<T>
CASSIO
Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstances,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Do not doubt that. Before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, Ill perform it
To the last article. My lord shall never rest,
Ill watch him tame and talk him out of patience.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I dare not say he lies anywhere.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Why, man?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
Hes a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, tis stabbing.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Go to. Where lodges he?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Can anything be made of this?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Can you inquire him out and be edified by report?
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
</T>
<T>
CLOWN
To do this is within the compass of mans wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Will you think so?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Think so, Iago?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
What,
To kiss in private?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
An unauthorized kiss!
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil.
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
So they do nothing, tis a venial slip.
But if I give my wife a handkerchief
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What then?
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Why then tis hers, my lord, and, being hers,
She may, I think, bestow t on any man.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
She is protectress of her honor too.
May she give that?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
You have seen nothing then?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
What, did they never whisper?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Never, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Nor send you out o' th' way?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Never.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Never, my lord.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Thats strange.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake. If you think other
Remove your thought, it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head
Let heaven requite it with the serpents curse
For if she be not honest, chaste, and true
Theres no man happy. The purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Oh, pardon me, twill do me good to walk.
</T>
<T>
LODOVICO
Madam, good night. I humbly thank your ladyship.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Your honor is most welcome.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Will you walk, sir?O Desdemona
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
My lord?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be returned
Forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there, look t be done.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
He says he will return incontinent,
And hath commanded me to go to bed
And bid me to dismiss you.
</T>
<T>
EMILIA
Dismiss me?
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
It was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu.
We must not now displease him.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
Quick, quick! Fear nothing. Ill be at thy elbow.
It makes us, or it mars us. Think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
Be near at hand, I may miscarry in t.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
Here, at thy hand. Be bold, and take thy stand.
</T>
<T>
RODERIGO
I have no great devotion to the deed
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
</T>
<T>
IAGO
(aside) I have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobbed from him
As gifts to Desdemona.
It must not be. If Cassio do remain
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor
May unfold me to himthere stand I in much peril.
No, he must die. But so, I hear him coming.
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars,
It is the cause. Yet Ill not shed her blood,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else shell betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light.
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore
Should I repent me. But once put out thy light,
Thou cunningst pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have plucked thy rose
I cannot give it vital growth again,
It must needs wither. Ill smell thee on the tree.
Oh, balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
And love thee after. (kissing her) One more, and thats the last.
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears. This sorrows heavenly,
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
</T>
<T>
DESDEMONA
Whos there? Othello?
</T>
<T>
OTHELLO
Ay, Desdemona.
</T>
