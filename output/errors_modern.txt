Continue, Solinus, and bring on my downfall. Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles.

DUKE
Merchant of Syracuse, stop your begging: Im not inclined to bend our laws. The hatred and discord between our two cities is the result of the bitter offenses your duke has perpetrated against the merchants of Ephesus, our well-behaved countrymen. Lacking the money to ransom themselves, these merchants were executed under your dukes harsh laws, and this has erased all looks of pity from my face. Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours, both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns. Nothe law goes further: if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuses marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus, that man dies, and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke, unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself. Your possessions, even if we calculate their worth very generously, dont even add up to a hundred marks. Therefore, by law, you are condemned to die.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
At least I have this comfort: when you finish speaking, my troubles will also end, at sundown.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Well, Syracusian, tell usbrieflywhy you left your hometown and came to Ephesus.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Asking me to speak of my unspeakable griefsthats the hardest task you could impose on me. But Ill do it so that the world can see that it was natural emotion, and not a desire to break the law, that brought me to this fate. Ill tell you whatever my sorrow permits me to say. I was born in Syracuse, and I married a womana fortunate woman, except for having been married to me. And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad. I lived with her in joy, and our wealth increased from the prosperous journeys I frequently made to Epidamnum. Then my agent died and, obligated to care for my now untended goods abroad, I was drawn away from my wifes fond embraces. I hadnt been gone for six months when my wife, almost fainting with the pains of pregnancy, made arrangements to follow me, and she soon arrived safely where I was. She hadnt been there very long before she became the joyful mother of twin boys. It was strange: they looked so much alike that the only way to tell them apart was by their names. In the same hour, and in the same inn, a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys. Their parents had very little, so I bought the boys and raised them as companions and servants for our twin sons. My wife was more than a little proud of our two boys, and every day she would press me to return home. Reluctantly, I agreedalas! Too quickly, we boarded a ship.
</T>
<T>
We had sailed a leagueleague = about three milesleague away from Epidamnum before the sea, which always obeys the winds' commands, gave any indication of danger.
We didnt stay hopeful much longer: soon, the sky grew so dark that we were convinced we were going to die immediately. I could have accepted that, but I was forced by my wifes incessant weepingshe wept in advance for the things that she saw aheadand the piteous complaints of the sweet infantswho cried in imitation of the adults, without understanding whyto find a way to save us. Heres the best I could do: the crew of our ship had fled for safety in the lifeboats and left us to sink with the ship. My wife, who was very concerned about the younger of our twins, tied him to a spare mastthe kind that sailors use for just such a purpose. She tied one of the other twins to him. I did the same with the remaining two boys. With the children taken care of, my wife and I tied ourselves to opposite ends of the mast and floated off, obedient to the current. It carried us toward Corinthor so we thought. Eventually the sun, looking down upon the earth, burned off the threatening storm clouds. By the power of the suns wished-for light, the seas became calm. We saw two ships sailing toward us, one from Corinth, the other from Epidaurus. But before they reached uslet me say no more! Youll have to imagine what came next, based on what had already happened.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
No, keep going, old man; dont stop like that. For we may take pity on you, even if we cant pardon you.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Had the gods taken pity on us, I wouldnt be here calling them merciless. The two ships hadnt come within ten leagues of us when our ship hit a huge rock and split down the middle. As we were unjustly separated from each other, both my wife and I were left with something to delight in and something to sorrow over. For her partthe poor soul! Her half of the mast weighed less, but she was no luckier than I was: the wind carried her away more quickly. I saw them rescued by fishermen from Corinthor so I thought. After a while, another ship rescued me and the two boys who were with me. The sailors knew me, so they took good care of us. Our ship would have caught up with the other ship and taken back my wife and the children, but we sailed too slowly and their ship sped toward their home. So now youve heard how I was separated from everything I love. Its been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
And for the sake of those you grieve for, do me a favor: tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them, up to this point.
</T>

My youngest son, whom I care about the most, turned eighteen and started to wonder about his twin brother. He asked me to let him take his attendantwho had also lost a brother, though he had kept his brothers

<T>
name for himselfand go in search of him. I wanted to see my lost son as well, so I risked losing the one I loved in order to find the other. Ive spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia. On my way home, I came to Ephesus. I have no hope of finding my boys here, but I will check every place that is inhabited by men. But that is where the story of my life must end. Id be happy to die if, in all my travels, I could prove that they are alive.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Poor Egeon! Fate has decreed that you must endure the extremes of terrible misfortune. Believe me, if it werent against the law, my crown, my duty, and my position (which princes cannot disobey, not matter how they feel), my very soul would argue your case. But you are sentenced to death, and changing a sentence thats already been passed would dishonor my title. However, Ill do what I can for you. I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus. Call any friends you have. Beg or borrow to come up with the ransom. If you can, you live. If not, you are doomed to die. Jailer, take him into custody.
</T>
<T>
JAILER
I will.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Hopeless and helpless, I go my way, merely putting off my fatal end.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
So, tell people that youre from Epidamnumotherwise all your goods will be confiscated. Just today, a merchant from Syracuse was arrested for coming here. He couldnt afford the ransom, so by law, hell be put to death before the sun sets. Heres the money you asked me to hold.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Dromio, bring this money to the Centaur Inn, where were lodging, and wait there until I come. Itll be lunchtime within an hour. Until then, Ill walk around town, peruse the markets, and gaze upon the buildings, and then Ill return and sleep at the inn. Im stiff and weary from all this travel. Get going now.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Hes a trustworthy servant. Often, when Im dulled by worry and melancholy, he lightens my mood with his merry pranks. Listen, will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn?

ADRIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned, even though I sent the slave off running. Surely, Luciana, its already two o'clock.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch. Sister, lets eat and stop worrying. A man is master of his own freedom: time is his only master, and when the right moment comes along, hell come or go as he pleases. If this is so, be patient, sister.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Why should men be more free than women?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Because their business lies outside the home.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Listen, when I behave this way toward him, he hates it.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Oh, you should know that hes the bridlebridle = muzzlelike device used to restrain a horsebridle to your will.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Only a mule would agree to that.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Why, too much freedom leads to woe. Theres nothing under heaven that doesnt have its limits. The beasts on the earth, the fish in the sea, and the birds in the sky are all subject to the males of their species and under their control. Men, who are nearest to God, are the masters of all these creatures. And menthe lords of the wide

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur, and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me. I havent spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier. Here he comes.
</T>
<T>
So, sir. Are you over your ridiculous mood? If you like being hit, crack some more jokes. You never heard of the Centaur? You werent given any gold? Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner? The Phoenix is my house? Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Said what, sir? When did I say all that?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Just now. Right here. Less than half an hour ago.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I havent seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
You moron, you denied having any gold, and you told me about a mistress and a lunch. And I hope you realized I wasnt very happy about it.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Im glad to see you in such a merry mood. But whats the joke? Please, master, tell me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Angelo, please excuse us. My wife gets angry when Im late. Heres the story well tell her: that I was with you at your shop, watching you make her necklace, and that youre going to deliver it tomorrow. But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him, told him Id given him a thousand marks in gold, and then lied about my wife and my house. You drunkard, what was that all about?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say what you want, but I know what I know. You beat me at the marketplace, and I have the bruises to prove it. If my skin were paper and your punches were ink, you could read the beating on my body.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I think youre an ass.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Honestly, it sure looks that way, judging by all the beatings and the bad treatment Im getting. Since Im an ass, I ought to kick like one. Then youd be scared of me and keep away.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Signior Balthasar, you look upset. I hope the good meal Im going to give you will show the goodwill I bear you and how welcome you are.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Have you completely forgotten your duty as a husband? Antipholus, your marriage is still fresh and new, like the springtimehave the young shoots of your love already started to wither? Is the building of your love already in ruins? If you married my sister for her wealth, then for her wealths sake, treat her with more kindness. Or if your affection has already strayed to another woman, at least be stealthy about it. Hide your false love, blindfold yourself so my sister cannot read your faithlessness in your eyes. Watch what you say, and dont let your own words give away your shame. Look sweet and act kindlybe attractive in your disloyalty. Disguise your misbehavior as integrity, and behave properly even if your heart is tainted. Though you are sinful, carry yourself like a holy saint. Be false in secret: why does she need to know? What foolish thief brags about his crimes? Its doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes. When you do something shameful, its possible to put a good spin on it, but bad deeds are made worse by speaking of them. Alas, poor women! Were so gullible, we believe it when you say you love us. Even if you love someone else in your heart, make it appear as if you love us. We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us. So, my sweet brother-in-law, go inside. Comfort my sister, cheer her up, call her wife. Its a holy thing to lie a little when sweet flattery can smooth over trouble.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

SECOND MERCHANT
Youve owed me this money since the Pentecost holiday. I havent pressed you for it, and I wouldnt now except that Im going to Persia and I need money for the trip. So pay me now, or Ill have this officer arrest you.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you. Just before I ran into you, I gave him a necklace. At five o'clock hes going to pay me for it. Please, come to his house with me. Ill pay what I owe you then and say thank you as well.
</T>
<T>
OFFICER
He saves you the trouble: look, here he comes.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
(to DROMIO) Im going to the jewelers house. You go buy a piece of ropeIll whip my wife and her cohorts for locking me out of my own house. Wait a minute! I see the jeweler. Go, be gone with you. Buy a rope and bring it to me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Oh, Luciana, did he tempt you like that? Could you tell from his face if he was serious? Yes or no? Did he look flushed or pale? Sad or happy? Could you tell from his looks what he was feeling in his heart?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
First, he said you had no right to him.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He meant he did nothing right for mewhich is true, unfortunately.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then he swore he was a stranger here.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And thats truehe is being strange. And yet he lies as well, for hes no stranger.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then I pleaded for you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And what did he say?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
How did he try to persuade you to love him?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
With words thatif they were spoken honestlymight have moved me. First, he praised my beauty, then my eloquence.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Did you praise him as well?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend, and every one of them knows my name. Some of them give me money, some invite me places, some thank me for the kind things Ive done for them, some try to sell me things. Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements. These are tricks of the imagination, and this place is filled with magicians.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Heres the money you wanted, master. Hey, have you gotten rid of that AdamDromio calls the officer Adam because, after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, Adam wore clothing made of skins, llike the officers leather uniform.Adam?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What gold is this? Whos this Adam you speak of?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden, but the Adam from the jailhouse. The one that wears leather clothes. The one that grabbed you and arrested you.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I dont know what youre talking about.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Dont worry, man, I wont try to escape. When its time for me to be freed, Ill pay you the fee youre entitled to for arresting me. My wifes in a perverse mood today. Shell be suspicious when the messenger tells her that I was arrested. I tell you, this will make her angry when she hears about it.
</T>
<T>
Heres my servant. I think hes got the money. Hello there, sir! Do you have what I told you to get?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Yes. And this rope will take care of everybody, I guarantee it.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
But wheres the money?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I spent it on this rope.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
You idiot! Five hundred ducats for a rope?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Why did I just send you home?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To get a piece of rope. And here I am, with that piece.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And Ill use that piece of rope to welcome you with. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)

<T>
ANGELO
Im sorry that I delayed you, sir. But even though he denies it, I swear he got the necklace from me.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Whats this mans reputation like here in the city?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
People think very highly of him. The merchants give him unlimited credit. Hes well beloved, second to none in the city. Id trust him with everything I own.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Speak more quietly: I think hes coming this way.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Youre right. And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didnt have! Good sir, stay close to me. Ill speak to him. Signior Antipholus, I cant believe youd put me to this kind of shame and troublenot to mention the scandal youve brought on yourself. You swore I never gave you the necklace, but now youre wearing it openly. Not only has your lie cost you money, shame, and imprisonment, but youve also mistreated this honest friend of mine. If it hadnt been for this dispute, he would have already hoisted sail and left for sea. You got that necklace from me: can you deny that?
</T>
