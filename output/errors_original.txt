EGEON
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.
I am not partial to infringe our laws.
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns.
Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus
Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again, if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levid
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou dep-artedst from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,
Ill utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy. Our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum, till my factors death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herselfalmost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrivd where I was.
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons,
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
As could not be distinguished but by names.
That very hour, and in the selfsame inn,
A meaner woman was deliverd
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return.
Unwilling, I agreed. Alas, too soon
We came aboard.
</T>
<T>
A league from Epidamnum had we sailed
Before the always-wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm;
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death,
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourned for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fastened him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms.
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixed,
Fastened ourselves at either end the mast
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapors that offended us,
And by the benefit of his wished light
The seas waxed calm, and we discoverd
Two ships from far, making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
But ere they came,O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Nay, forward, old man. Do not break off so,
For we may pity though not pardon thee.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily termed them merciless to us.
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounterd by a mighty rock,
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdend
With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind,
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwracked guests,
And would have reft the fishers of their prey
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me severed from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolonged
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother, and importuned me
That his attendantso his case was like,
</T>
<T>
Reft of his brother, but retained his name
Might bear him company in the quest of him,
Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbors men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
</T>
<T>
DUKE
Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have marked
To bear the extremity of dire mishap,
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
But though thou art adjudgd to the death,
And passd sentence may not be recalled
But to our honours great disparagement,
Yet will I favor thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, Ill limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help.
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live. If no, then thou art doomd to die.
Jailer, take him to thy custody.
</T>
<T>
JAILER
I will, my lord.
</T>
<T>
EGEON
Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here
And, not being able to buy out his life,
According to the statute of the town
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinnertime.
Till that, Ill view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Many a man would take you at your word
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
</T>
<T>
FIRST MERCHANT
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Neither my husband nor the slave returned
That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart hes somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret.
A man is master of his liberty;
Time is their master, and when they see time
Theyll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Because their business still lies out o' door.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Theres none but asses will be bridled so.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Why, headstrong liberty is lashed with woe.
Theres nothing situate under heavens eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
The beasts, the fishes, and the wingd fowls
Are their males' subjects and at their controls.
Man, more divine, the masters of all these,
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
Is wandered forth, in care to seek me out.
By computation and mine hosts report,
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
</T>
<T>
How now, sir? is your merry humor altered?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? You received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Villain, thou didst deny the golds receipt
And toldst me of a mistress and a dinner,
For which, I hope, thou feltst I was displeased.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
Say that I lingered with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that tomorrow you will bring it home.
But heres a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
I think thou art an ass.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick being kicked; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Youre sad, Signior Balthasar. Pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
And may it be that you have quite forgot
A husbands office? Shall, Antipholus,
Even in the spring of love thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealths sake use her with more kindness.
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness.
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shames orator;
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtues harbinger.
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted.
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.
Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board.
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managd;
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women, make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us.
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again.
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Sweet mistresswhat your name is else I know not,
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
And since I have not much importuned you,
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
Therefore make present satisfaction,
Or Ill attach you by this officer.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Even just the sum that I do owe to you
Is growing to me by Antipholus.
And in the instant that I met with you,
He had of me a chain. At five o'clock
I shall receive the money for the same.
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
</T>
<T>
COURTESAN'S OFFICER
That labor may you save. See where he comes.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
While I go to the goldsmiths house, go thou
And buy a ropes end. That will I bestow
Among my wife and her confederates
For locking me out of my doors by day.
But soft. I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone.
Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
That he did plead in earnest, yea or no?
Looked he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
What observation madst thou in this case
Of his hearts meteors tilting in his face?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
First he denied you had in him no right.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
Then pleaded I for you.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
And what said he?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
That love i begged for you he begged of me.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
</T>
<T>
LUCIANA
With words that in an honest suit might move.
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
</T>
<T>
ADRIANA
Didst speak him fair?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
Theres not a man I meet but doth salute me
As if I were their well-acquainted friend,
And every one doth call me by my name.
Some tender money to me; some invite me;
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
Some offer me commodities to buy.
Even now a tailor called me in his shop
And showed me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
And lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Master, heres The gold you sent me for. What, have you gotthe picture of old Adam new-appareled?
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, but that Adam thatkeeps the prison; he that goes in the calfs skin that waskilled for the Prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like anevil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
I understand thee not.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Fear me not, man. I will not break away:
Ill give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
To warrant thee, as I am rested for.
My wife is in a wayward mood today
And will not lightly trust the messenger
That I should be attached in Ephesus.
I tell you, twill sound harshly in her ears.
</T>
<T>
Here comes my man. I think he brings the money.
How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Heres that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
But wheres the money?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Ill serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
</T>
<T>
DROMIO OF EPHESUS
To a ropes end, sir, and to that end am I returned.
</T>
<T>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you. (beats DROMIO OF EPHESUS)
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
I am sorry, sir, that I have hindered you,
But I protest he had the chain of me,
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
How is the man esteemed here in the city?
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
Of very reverend reputation, sir,
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
Second to none that lives here in the city.
His word might bear my wealth at any time.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MERCHANT
Speak softly. Yonder, as I think, he walks.
</T>
<T>
ANGELO
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
Good sir, draw near to me. Ill speak to him.
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble,
And not without some scandal to yourself,
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain, which now you wear so openly.
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.
This chain you had of me. Can you deny it?
</T>
