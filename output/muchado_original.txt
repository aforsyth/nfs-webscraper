<T>
LEONATO
I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Aragon comes this
night to Messina.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
He is very near by this. He was not three leagues off when
I left him.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
But few of any sort, and none of name.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much
honor on a young Florentine called Claudio.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Much deserved on his part, and equally remembered by
Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of
his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He
hath indeed better bettered expectation than you must
expect of me to tell you how.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of
it.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
I have already delivered him letters, and there appears
much joy in himeven so much that joy could not show
itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Did he break out into tears?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
In great measure.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than
those that are so washed. How much better is it to weep at
joy than to joy at weeping!
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
I pray you, is Signor Montanto returned from the wars or
no?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the
army of any sort.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
What is he that you ask for, niece?
</T>
<T>
HERO
My cousin means Signor Benedick of Padua.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Oh, hes returned, and as pleasant as ever he was.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged Cupid at
the flight, and my uncles Fool, reading the challenge,
subscribed for Cupid and challenged him at the bird-bolt.
I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these
wars? But how many hath he killed? For indeed I promised
to eat all of his killing.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Faith, niece, you tax Signor Benedick too much, but hell be
meet with you, I doubt it not.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a
very valiant trencherman. He hath an excellent stomach.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
And a good soldier too, lady.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuffed with all honorable
virtues.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
It is so indeed. He is no less than a stuffed man. But for the
stuffingwell, we are all mortal.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of
merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her. They never
meet but theres a skirmish of wit between them.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his
five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man
governed with one, so that if he have wit enough to keep
himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between
himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion
now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Is t possible?
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of
his hat; it ever changes with the next block.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
No. An he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you,
who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that
will make a voyage with him to the devil?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease! He is sooner
caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently
mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the
Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere a be cured.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
I will hold friends with you, lady.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
Do, good friend.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
You will never run mad, niece.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
No, not till a hot January.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Don Pedro is approached.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Good Signor Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble?
The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter
it.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your
Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain, but
when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness
takes his leave.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your
daughter.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Her mother hath many times told me so.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Signor Benedick, no, for then were you a child.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you
are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers herself.Be
happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
If Signor Leonato be her father, she would not have his
head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick.
Nobody marks you.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as Signor Benedick? Courtesy itself must
convert to disdain if you come in her presence.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies, only you excepted. And I would I could find in
my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
A dear happiness to women. They would else have been
troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold
blood I am of your humor for that. I had rather hear my dog
bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
God keep your Ladyship still in that mind, so some gentle-
man or other shall scape a predestinate scratched face.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
Scratching could not make it worse an twere such a face as
yours were.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good
a continuer. But keep your way, i' Gods name. I have done.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
You always end with a jades trick. I know you of old.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
That is the sum of all, Leonato.Signior Claudio and
Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath invited you
all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he
heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare
swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. (to DON
JOHN) Let me bid you welcome, my lord. Being reconciled
to the Prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
I thank you. I am not of many words, but I thank you.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Please it your Grace lead on?
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Your hand, Leonato. We will go together.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I noted her not, but I looked on her.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Is she not a modest young lady?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Do you question me as an honest man should do, for my
simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after
my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Why, i' faith, methinks shes too low for a high praise, too
brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise. Only
this commendation I can afford her, that were she other
than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but
as she is, I do not like her.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how
thou likst her.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Would you buy her, that you enquire after her?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Can the world buy such a jewel?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad
brow? Or do you play the flouting jack, to tell us Cupid is
a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in
what key shall a man take you to go in the song?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I looked on.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter.
Theres her cousin, an she were not possessed with a fury,
exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the
last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn
husband, have you?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Is t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but
he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a
bachelor of three-score again? Go to, i' faith, an thou wilt
needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and
sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is returned to seek
you.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
What secret hath held you here that you followed not to
Leonatos?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
I charge thee on thy allegiance.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
You hear, Count Claudio? I can be secret as a dumb man, I
would have you think so, but on my allegiancemark you
this, on my allegiance(to DON PEDRO) he is in love. With
who? Now, that is your Graces part. Mark how short his
answer is: with Hero, Leonatos short daughter.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
If this were so, so were it uttered.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Like the old tale, my lord: It is not so nor twas not so but,
indeed, God forbid it should be so.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be
otherwise.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
By my troth, I speak my thought.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
That I love her, I feel.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
That she is worthy, I know.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how
she should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt
out
of me. I will die in it at the stake.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
That a woman conceived me, I thank her. That she brought
me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks. But that I
will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle
in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me.
Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will
do myself the right to trust none. And the fine is, for the
which I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not
with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than
I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a
ballad-makers pen and hang me up at the door of a brothel
house for the sign of blind Cupid.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove
a notable argument.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me, and he
that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder and called
Adam.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Well, as time shall try.
In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
it, pluck off the bulls horns and set them in my forehead,
and let me be vilely painted, and in such great letters as they
write Here is good horse to hire let them signify under my
sign Here you may see Benedick the married man.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou
wilt quake for this shortly.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I look for an earthquake too, then.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Well, you temporize with the hours. In the meantime, good
Signior Benedick, repair to Leonatos. Commend me to
him and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he
hath made great preparation.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage,
and so I commit you
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
To the tuition of God. From my house, if I had it
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is
sometimes guarded with fragments and the guards are but
slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any
further, examine your conscience. And so I leave you.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
My liege, your highness now may do me good.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
My love is thine to teach. Teach it but how,
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
No child but Hero; shes his only heir.
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
O, my lord,
When you went onward on this ended action,
I looked upon her with a soldiers eye,
That liked but had a rougher task in hand
Than to drive liking to the name of love.
But now I am returned and that war thoughts
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
Saying I liked her ere I went to wars.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Was t not to this end
That thou beganst to twist so fine a story?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
How sweetly you do minister to love,
That know loves grief by his complexion!
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
The fairest grant is the necessity.
Look what will serve is fit. 'Tis once, thou lovest,
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
I know we shall have reveling tonight.
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom Ill unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale.
Then after to her father will I break,
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practice let us put it presently.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he
provided this music?
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
news that you yet dreamt not of.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Are they good?
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
As the events stamps them, but they have a good cover;
they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio,
walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard, were
thus much overheard by a man of mine: the Prince
discovered to Claudio that he loved my niece your daughter
and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance, and if he
found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by
the top and instantly break with you of it.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him
yourself.
</T>
<T>
CONRAD
What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of
measure sad?
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds. Therefore
the sadness is without limit.
</T>
<T>
CONRAD
You should hear reason.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
</T>
<T>
CONRAD
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayst thou art, born
under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral medicine to a
mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am. I must be sad
when I have cause and smile at no mans jests, eat when I
have stomach and wait for no mans leisure, sleep when I am
drowsy and tend on no mans business, laugh when I am
merry and claw no man in his humor.
</T>
<T>
CONRAD
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you
may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out
against your brother, and he hath ta'en you newly into his
grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but
by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that
you frame the season for your own harvest.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Was not Count John here at supper?
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
I saw him not.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I
am heartburned an hour after.
</T>
<T>
HERO
He is of a very melancholy disposition.
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
He were an excellent man that were made just in the
midway between him and Benedick. The one is too like an
image and says nothing, and the other too like my ladys
eldest son, evermore tattling.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Then half Signor Benedicks tongue in Count Johns
mouth, and half Count Johns melancholy in Signor
Benedicks face
</T>
<T>
BEATRICE
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough
in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the
world, if he could get her goodwill.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
In faith, shes too curst.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
It is so. The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
Leonato.
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
Yea, my lord, but I can cross it.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be med'cinable to
me. I am sick in displeasure to him, and whatsoever comes
athwart his affection ranges evenly with mine. How canst
thou cross this marriage?
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
Not honestly, my lord, but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
Show me briefly how.
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in
the favor of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
I remember.
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, appoint her
to look out at her ladys chamber window.
</T>
<T>
DON JOHN
What life is in that to be the death of this marriage?
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to the
Prince your brother. Spare not to tell him that he hath
wronged his honor in marrying the renowned Claudio,
whose estimation do you mightily hold up, to a
contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Boy!
</T>
<T>
BOY
Signior?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
In my chamber window lies a book. Bring it hither to me in
the orchard.
</T>
<T>
BOY
I am here already, sir.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I know that, but I would have thee hence and here again.
</T>
<T>
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much another
man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love, will,
after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others,
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love
and such a man is Claudio. I have known when there was no
music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he
rather hear the tabor and the pipe. I have known when he
would have walked ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and
now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new
doublet. He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,
like an honest man and a soldier, and now is he turned
orthography; his words are a very fantastical banquet, just
so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not.
</T>
<T>
HERO
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor.
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,
And bid her steal into the pleachd bower
Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun
Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her
To listen our propose. This is thy office.
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
Ill make her come, I warrant you, presently.
</T>
<T>
HERO
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
As we do trace this alley up and down,
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit.
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupids crafty arrow made,
That only wounds by hearsay.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and then go
I toward Aragon.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Ill bring you thither, my lord, if youll vouchsafe me.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to
wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company,
for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all
mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and
the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as
sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his
heart thinks, his tongue speaks.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Gallants, I am not as I have been.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
So say I. Methinks you are sadder.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
I hope he be in love.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Hang him, truant! Theres no true drop of blood in him to
be truly touched with love. If he be sad, he wants money.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
I have the toothache.
</T>
<T>
DON PEDRO
Draw it.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Hang it!
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Are you good men and true?
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation,
body and soul.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they
should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the
Princes watch.
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
</T>
<T>
FIRST WATCHMAN
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write
and read.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blessed you with
a good name. To be a well-favored man is the gift of fortune,
but to write and read comes by nature.
</T>
<T>
SEACOLE
Both which, Master Constable
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
You have. I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your
favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it,
and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there
is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the
most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch;
therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge:
</T>
<T>
HERO
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice and desire her to
rise.
</T>
<T>
URSULA
I will, lady.
</T>
<T>
HERO
And bid her come hither.
</T>
<T>
URSULA
Well.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
Troth, I think your other rebato were better.
</T>
<T>
HERO
No, pray thee, good Meg, Ill wear this.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
By my troth, s not so good, and I warrant your cousin will
say so.
</T>
<T>
HERO
My cousins a fool, and thou art another. Ill wear none but
this.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair were a
thought browner; and your gowns a most rare fashion, i'
faith. I saw the Duchess of Milans gown that they praise so.
</T>
<T>
HERO
Oh, that exceeds, they say.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
What would you with me, honest neighbor?
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that
decerns you nearly.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Marry, this it is, sir.
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Yes, in truth it is, sir.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
What is it, my good friends?
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter. An old
man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would
desire they were, but, in faith, honest as the skin between
his brows.
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an
old man and no honester than I.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Comparisons are odorous. Palabras, neighbor Verges.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Neighbors, you are tedious.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
It pleases your Worship to say so, but we are the poor dukes
officers. But truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as
a king, I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your
worship.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Come, Friar Francis, be brief, only to the plain form of
marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties
afterwards.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
(to CLAUDIO) You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady?
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
No.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
To be married to her.Friar, you come to marry her.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count?
</T>
<T>
HERO
I do.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
If either of you know any inward impediment why you
should not be conjoined, charge you on your souls to utter
it.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Know you any, Hero?
</T>
<T>
HERO
None, my lord.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
Know you any, count?
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Oh, a stool and a cushion for the Sexton.
</T>
<T>
SEXTON
Which be the malefactors?
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Marry, that am I and my partner.
</T>
<T>
VERGES
Nay, thats certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
</T>
<T>
SEXTON
But which are the offenders that are to be examined? Let
them come before Master Constable.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Yea, marry, let them come before me.
What is your name, friend?
</T>
<T>
Whats your name, friend?
</T>
<T>
BORACHIO
Borachio.
</T>
<T>
DOGBERRY
Pray, write down, Borachio.Yours, sirrah?
</T>
<T>
CONRADE
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,
And tis not wisdom thus to second grief
Against yourself.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve. Give not me counsel,
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so loved his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine,
And bid him speak of patience.
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form.
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry hem when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters, bring him yet to me
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man. For, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel, but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion which before
Would give preceptial med'cine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air, and agony with words.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at my
hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living shall come
over it, for in most comely truth thou deservest it.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
To have no man come over me! Why, shall I always keep
below stairs?
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhounds mouth; it catches.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
And yours as blunt as the fencers foils, which hit but hurt
not.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
A most manly wit, Margaret, it will not hurt a woman. And
so, I pray thee, call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the pikes with
a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
</T>
<T>
MARGARET
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
Is this the monument of Leonato?
</T>
<T>
FIRST LORD
It is, my lord.
</T>
<T>
CLAUDIO
(reading an epitaph)
Done to death by slanderous tongues
Was the Hero that here lies.
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
Gives her fame which never dies.
So the life that died with shame
Lives in death with glorious fame.
</T>
<T>
Hang thou there upon the tomb,
Praising her when I am dumb.
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
(Song)
Pardon, goddess of thenight,
Those that slew thy virginknight,
For the which with songs ofwoe
Round about her tomb theygo.
Midnight, assist ourmoan.
Help us to sigh andgroan
Heavily, heavily.
Graves, yawn and yield yourdead,
Till death beutterd,
Heavily,heavily.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
Did I not tell you she was innocent?
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her
Upon the error that you heard debated.
But Margaret was in some fault for this,
Although against her will, as it appears
In the true course of all the question.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
And so am I, being else by faith enforced
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
</T>
<T>
LEONATO
Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
And when I send for you, come hither masked.
The Prince and Claudio promised by this hour
To visit me.You know your office, brother.
You must be father to your brothers daughter,
And give her to young Claudio.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
Which I will do with confirmed countenance.
</T>
<T>
BENEDICK
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
</T>
<T>
FRIAR FRANCIS
To do what, Signior?
</T>
