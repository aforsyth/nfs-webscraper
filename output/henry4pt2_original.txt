RUMOR
Open your ears, for which of you will stop
The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?
I, from the orient to the drooping west,
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
The acts commenced on this ball of earth.
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
The which in every language I pronounce,
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
I speak of peace while covert enmity
Under the smile of safety wounds the world.
And who but Rumor, who but only I,
Make fearful musters and prepared defense,
Whiles the big year, swoll'n with some other grief,
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,
And of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
The still-discordant wav'ring multitude,
Can play upon it. But what need I thus
My well-known body to anatomize
Among my household? Why is Rumor here?
I run before King Harrys victory,
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I
To speak so true at first? My office is
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
</T>
<T>
Under the wrath of noble Hotspurs sword,
And that the King before the Douglas' rage
Stooped his anointed head as low as death.
This have I rumored through the peasant towns
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
Where Hotspurs father, old Northumberland,
Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
And not a man of them brings other news
Than they have learnt of me. From Rumors tongues
They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.
</T>
<T>
LORD BARDOLPH
Who keeps the gate here, ho?
</T>
<T>
Where is the Earl?
</T>
<T>
PORTER
What shall I say you are?
</T>
<T>
LORD BARDOLPH
Tell thou the Earl
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
</T>
<T>
PORTER
His lordship is walked forth into the orchard.
Please it your Honor knock but at the gate
And he himself will answer.
</T>
<T>
LORD BARDOLPH
Here comes the Earl.
</T>
<T>
NORTHUMBERLAND
What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now
Should be the father of some stratagem.
The times are wild. Contention, like a horse
Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
And bears down all before him.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
</T>
<T>
PAGE
He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but,
for the party that owed it, he might have more diseases than
he knew for.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this
foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent
anything that tends to laughter more than I invent, or is
invented on me. I am not only witty in myself, but the cause
that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath
overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the Prince put
thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off,
why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake,
thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels.
I was never manned with an agate till now, but I will inset
you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send
you back again to your master for a jewel. The juvenal, the
Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledgeI will
sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he
shall get one off his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say
his face is a face royal. God may finish it when He will. 'Tis
not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for
a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it, and yet hell be
crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was
a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but hes almost out of
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,
And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.
And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
</T>
<T>
MOWBRAY
I well allow the occasion of our arms,
But gladly would be better satisfied
How in our means we should advance ourselves
To look with forehead bold and big enough
Upon the power and puissance of the King.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Our present musters grow upon the file
To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice,
And our supplies live largely in the hope
Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
With an incensd fire of injuries.
</T>
<T>
LORD BARDOLPH
The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:
Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand
May hold up head without Northumberland.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
With him we may.
</T>
<T>
LORD BARDOLPH
Yea, marry, theres the point.
But if without him we be thought too feeble,
My judgment is we should not step too far
Till we had his assistance by the hand.
For in a theme so bloody-faced as this,
Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Master Fang, have you entered the action?
</T>
<T>
FANG
It is entered.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Wheres your yeoman? Is t a lusty yeoman? Will a'
stand to t?
</T>
<T>
FANG
Sirrah! Wheres Snare?
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
O Lord, ay, good Master Snare.
</T>
<T>
SNARE
Here, here.
</T>
<T>
FANG
Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Yea, good Master Snare, I have entered him and all.
</T>
<T>
SNARE
It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
Alas the day, take heed of him. He stabbed me in mine own
house, and that most beastly, in good faith. He cares not what
mischief he does. If his weapon be out, he will foin like any
devil. He will spare neither man, woman, nor child.
</T>
<T>
FANG
If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Before God, I am exceeding weary.
</T>
<T>
POINS
Is t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have
attached one of so high blood.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Faith, it does me; though it discolors the complexion of my
greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vilely in me
to desire small beer?
</T>
<T>
POINS
Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to
remember so weak a composition.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my
troth, I do now remember the poor creature small beer. But
indeed these humble considerations make me out of love
with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how
many pair of silk stockings thou hastwith these, and those
that were thy peach-colored onesor to bear the inventory
of thy shirts, as, one for superfluity and another for use. But
that the tennis-court keeper knows better than I, for it is a
low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket
there, as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of
the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland; and
God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen
shall inherit His kingdom; but the midwives say the children
are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases and
kindreds are mightily strengthened.
</T>
<T>
NORTHUMBERLAND
I pray thee, loving wife and gentle daughter,
Give even way unto my rough affairs.
Put not you on the visage of the times
And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.
</T>
<T>
LADY NORTHUMBERLAND
I have given over. I will speak no more.
Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
</T>
<T>
NORTHUMBERLAND
Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn,
And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
</T>
<T>
LADY PERCY
O yet, for Gods sake, go not to these wars.
The time was, father, that you broke your word,
When you were more endeared to it than now,
When your own Percy, when my hearts dear Harry,
Threw many a northward look to see his father
Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
There were two honors lost, yours and your sons.
For yours, the God of heaven brighten it.
For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
In the gray vault of heaven, and by his light
Did all the chivalry of England move
To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves.
He had no legs that practiced not his gait;
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
Became the accents of the valiant;
For those that could speak low and tardily
Would turn their own perfection to abuse
</T>
<T>
FRANCIS
What the devil hast thou brought thereapplejohns? Thou
knowest Sir John cannot endure an applejohn.
</T>
<T>
SECOND DRAWER
Mass, thou sayest true. The Prince once set a dish of
applejohns before him and told him there were five more Sir
Johns and, putting off his hat, said I will now take my leave
of these six dry, round, old, withered knights. It angered
him to the heart. But he hath forgot that.
</T>
<T>
FRANCIS
Why then, cover, and set them down, and see if thou canst
find out Sneaks noise. Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear
some music.
</T>
<T>
THIRD DRAWER
Dispatch: the room where they supped is too hot. Theyll
come in straight.
</T>
<T>
FRANCIS
Sirrah, here will be the Prince and Master Poins anon, and
they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons, and Sir John
must not know of it. Bardolph hath brought word.
</T>
<T>
THIRD DRAWER
By the Mass, here will be old utis. It will be an excellent
stratagem.
</T>
<T>
SECOND DRAWER
Ill see if I can find out Sneak.
</T>
<T>
KING
Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
But, ere they come, bid them o'erread these letters
And well consider of them. Make good speed.
</T>
<T>
How many thousand of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
Natures soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
Under the canopies of costly state,
And lulld with sound of sweetest melody?
O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
In loathsome beds and leavest the kingly couch
A watch-case or a common 'larum bell?
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
Seal up the shipboys eyes, and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge
And in the visitation of the winds,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
With deafening clamor in the slippery clouds
That with the hurly death itself awakes?
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
Come on, come on, come on. Give me your hand, sir, give
me your hand, sir. An early stirrer, by the rood. And how
doth my good cousin Silence?
</T>
<T>
SILENCE
Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
And how doth my cousin your bedfellow? And your fairest
daughter and mine, my goddaughter Ellen?
</T>
<T>
SILENCE
Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
By yea and no, sir. I dare say my cousin William is become
a good scholar. He is at Oxford still, is he not?
</T>
<T>
SILENCE
Indeed, sir, to my cost.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
He must then to the Inns o' Court shortly. I was once of
Clements Inn, where I think they will talk of mad Shallow
yet.
</T>
<T>
SILENCE
You were called Lusty Shallow then, cousin.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
By the Mass, I was called anything, and I would have done
anything indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little
John Doit of Staffordshire, and black George Barnes, and
Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotswold man. You
had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the Inns o' Court
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
What is this forest called?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
'Tis Gaultree Forest, an t shall please your Grace.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth
To know the numbers of our enemies.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
We have sent forth already.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
'Tis well done.
My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
I must acquaint you that I have received
New-dated letters from Northumberland,
Their cold intent, tenor, and substance, thus:
Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
As might hold sortance with his quality,
The which he could not levy; whereupon
He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,
To Scotland, and concludes in hearty prayers
That your attempts may overlive the hazard
And fearful melting of their opposite.
</T>
<T>
MOWBRAY
Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
And dash themselves to pieces.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Whats your name, sir? Of what condition are you, and of
what place, I pray?
</T>
<T>
COLEVILE
I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the Dale.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your degree,
and your place the Dale. Colevile shall be still your name, a
traitor your degree, and the dungeon your place, a place deep
enough so shall you be still Colevile of the Dale.
</T>
<T>
COLEVILE
Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye yield, sir, or
shall I sweat for you? If I do sweat, they are the drops of thy
lovers and they weep for thy death. Therefore rouse up fear
and trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
</T>
<T>
COLEVILE
I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that thought yield
me.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name. An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most active fellow in Europe. My womb, my womb, my womb undoes me. Here comes our general.
</T>
<T>
KING
Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
We will our youth lead on to higher fields
And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
Our navy is addressed, our power collected,
Our substitutes in absence well invested,
And everything lies level to our wish.
Only we want a little personal strength;
And pause us till these rebels now afoot
Come underneath the yoke of government.
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
Shall soon enjoy.
</T>
<T>
KING
Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
Where is the Prince your brother?
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
I think hes gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
</T>
<T>
KING
And how accompanied?
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
I do not know, my lord.
</T>
<T>
KING
Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
No, my good lord, he is in presence here.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
What would my lord and father?
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away tonight.What,
Davy, I say!
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
I will not excuse you. You shall not be excused. Excuses
shall not be admitted. There is no excuse shall serve. You
shall not be excused.Why, Davy!
</T>
<T>
DAVY
Here, sir.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy, let me see, Davy,
let me see. Yea, marry, William cook, bid him come
hither.Sir John, you shall not be excused.
</T>
<T>
DAVY
Marry, sir, thus: those precepts cannot be served. And again,
sir, shall we sow the hade land with wheat?
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook, are there no
young pigeons?
</T>
<T>
DAVY
Yes, sir. Here is now the smiths note for shoeing and plow
irons.
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?
</T>
<T>
CHIEF JUSTICE
How doth the King?
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
Exceeding well. His cares are now all ended.
</T>
<T>
CHIEF JUSTICE
I hope, not dead.
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
Hes walked the way of nature,
And to our purposes he lives no more.
</T>
<T>
CHIEF JUSTICE
I would his Majesty had called me with him.
The service that I truly did his life
Hath left me open to all injuries.
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
Indeed, I think the young King loves you not.
</T>
<T>
CHIEF JUSTICE
I know he doth not, and do arm myself
To welcome the condition of the time,
Which cannot look more hideously upon me
Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
</T>
<T>
WARWICK
Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.
O, that the living Harry had the temper
Of he the worst of these three gentlemen!
How many nobles then should hold their places
That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbor, we will
eat a last years pippin of my own graffing, with a dish of
caraways, and so forth.Come, cousin Silence.And then
to bed.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
Barren, barren, barren, beggars all, beggars all, Sir John.
Marry, good air.Spread, Davy, spread, Davy. Well said,
Davy.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
This Davy serves you for good uses. He is your servingman
and your husband.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet, Sir John. By
the Mass, I have drunk too much sack at supper. A good
varlet. Now sit down, now sit down.Come, cousin.
</T>
<T>
SILENCE
Ah, sirrah, quoth he, we shall
Do nothing but eat and make good cheer,
(sings) And praise God for the merry year,
When flesh is cheap and females dear,
And lusty lads roam here and there
So merrily,
And ever among so merrily.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Theres a merry heart!Good Master Silence, Ill give you
a health for that anon.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
No, thou arrant knave. I would to God that I might die, that
I might have thee hanged. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out
of joint.
</T>

FIRST BEADLE
The Constables have delivered her over to me, and she shall
have whipping cheer enough, I warrant her. There hath been
a man or two lately killed about her.

DOLL TEARSHEET
Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie! Come on, I ll tell thee what,
thou damned tripe-visaged rascal: an the child I now go with
do miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother,
thou paper-faced villain.
</T>
<T>
MISTRESS QUICKLY
O the Lord, that Sir John were come! I would make this a
bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her
womb might miscarry.
</T>
<T>
FIRST BEADLE
If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; you have
but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me, for the
man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.
</T>
<T>
DOLL TEARSHEET
Ill tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I will have you
as soundly swinged for this, you bluebottle rogue, you filthy
famished correctioner. If you be not swinged, Ill forswear
half-kirtles.

FIRST BEADLE
Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.

More rushes, more rushes.

Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow. I will make the
King do you grace. I will leer upon him as he comes by, and
do but mark the countenance that he will give me.

<T>
PISTOL
God bless thy lungs, good knight!
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Come here, Pistol, stand behind me.(to SHALLOW) O, if I
had had time to have made new liveries, I would have
bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But tis no
matter. This poor show doth better. This doth infer the zeal
I had to see him.
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
It doth so.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
It shows my earnestness of affection
</T>
<T>
SHALLOW
It doth so.

My devotion
