KING
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own childrens blood.
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Nor bruise her flowrets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces. Those opposd eyes,
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathd knife,
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
As far as to the sepulcher of Christ
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
We are impressd and engaged to fight
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
Whose arms were molded in their mothers' womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walked those blessd feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nailed
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
</T>
<T>
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
And bootless tis to tell you we will go.
Therefor we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butcherd,
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation
By those Welshwomen done, as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.
</T>
<T>
KING
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
This matched with other did, my gracious lord.
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the north and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood Day, the gallant Hotspur there,
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
That ever valiant and approvd Scot,
At Holmedon met, where they did spend
A sad and bloody hour
As by discharge of their artillery
And shape of likelihood the news was told;
For he that brought them, in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse,
Uncertain of the issue any way.
</T>
<T>
KING
Here is a dear, a true-industrious friend,
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
Stained with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited;
Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,
Balked in their own blood, did Sir Walter see
On Holmedons plains. Of prisoners Hotspur took
Mordake, Earl of Fife, and eldest son
To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Atholl,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
And is not this an honorable spoil?
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
In faith, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
</T>
<T>
KING
Yea, there thou makst me sad, and makst me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son,
A son who is the theme of Honors tongue,
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,
Who is sweet Fortunes minion and her pride;
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
See riot and dishonor stain the brow
Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
And called mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percys pride? The prisoners,
Which he in this adventure hath surprised
To his own use he keeps, and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake, Earl of Fife.
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
This is his uncles teaching. This is Worcester,
Malevolent to you in all aspects,
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity.
</T>
<T>
KING
But I have sent for him to answer this.
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor. So inform the lords.
But come yourself with speed to us again,
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be utterd.
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
I will, my liege.

FALSTAFF
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, andunbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benchesafter noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that trulywhich thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to dowith the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack,and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, anddials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sunhimself a fair hot wench in flame-colored taffeta, I see noreason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand thetime of the day.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take pursesgo by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,he,that wand'ring knight so fair. And I prithee, sweet wag,when thou art king, as God save thy GraceMajesty, Ishould say, for grace thou wilt have none
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
What, none?
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologueto an egg and butter.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us thatare squires of the nights body be called thieves of the daysbeauty. Let us be Dianas foresters, gentlemen of the shade,minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of goodgovernment, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble andchaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance westeal.
</T>
<T>
KING
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
Unapt to stir at these indignities,
And you have found me, for accordingly
You tread upon my patience. But be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself,
Mighty and to be feared, than my condition,
Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
And therefore lost that title of respect
Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
The scourge of greatness to be used on it,
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly.

<T>
NORTHUMBERLAND
My lord
</T>
<T>
KING
Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
O sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow.
You have good leave to leave us. When we need
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
</T>
<T>
(to NORTHUMBERLAND)You were about to speak.

PRINCE HENRY
He is walked up to the top of the hill. Ill go seek him.

FALSTAFF
I am accursed to rob in that thiefs company. The rascal hathremoved my horse and tied him I know not where. If I travelbut four foot by the square further afoot, I shall break mywind. Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, ifI scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn hiscompany hourly any time this two-and-twenty years, andyet I am bewitched with the rogues company. If the rascalhath not given me medicines to make me love him, Ill behanged. It could not be else: I have drunk medicines.Poins! Hal! A plague upon you both.Bardolph! Peto!Ill starve ere Ill rob a foot further. An twere not as gooda deed as drink to turn true man and to leave these rogues,I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth. Eightyards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles afootwith me, and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough.A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented tobe there, in respect of the love I bear your house. He couldbe contented; why is he not, then? In respect of the love hebears our househe shows in this he loves his own barnbetter than he loves our house. Let me see some more. Thepurpose you undertake is dangerous. Why, thats certain.'Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you,my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower,safety. The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friendsyou have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and yourwhole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great anopposition. Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, youare a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brainis this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid,our friends true and constanta good plot, good friends,and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends.What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of Yorkcommends the plot and the general course of the action.Zounds, an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him withhis ladys fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself?Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and OwenGlendower? Is there not besides the Douglas? Have I not alltheir letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the nextmonth, and are they not some of them set forward already?What a pagan rascal is thisan infidel! Ha, you shall seenow in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to theKing and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could dividemyself and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skimmilk with so honorable an action! Hang him, let him tell theKing. We are prepared. I will set forward tonight.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room and lend me thy handto laugh a little.
</T>
<T>
POINS
Where hast been, Hal?
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscorehogsheads. I have sounded the very bass string of humility.Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can callthem all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.They take it already upon their salvation that though I be butPrince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell meflatly am no proud jack, like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a ladof mettle, a good boyby the Lord, so they call meandwhen I am King of England, I shall command all the goodlads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep dyeing scarlet,and when you breathe in your watering, they cry Hem!and bid you Play it off! To conclude, I am so good aproficient in one quarter of an hour that I can drink with anytinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned,thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in thisaction; but, sweet Nedto sweeten which name of Ned, Igive thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped even now intomy hand by an underskinker, one that never spake otherEnglish in his life than Eight shillings and sixpence, andYou are welcome, with this shrill addition, Anon, anon,sir.Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon, or so. But,Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee, dothou stand in some by-room while I question my punydrawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou neverleave calling Francis, that his tale to me may be nothingbut Anon. Step aside, and Ill show thee a precedent.

MORTIMER
These promises are fair, the parties sure,
And our induction full of prosperous hope.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,
Will you sit down? And Uncle Worcester
A plague upon it, I have forgot the map.
</T>
<T>
GLENDOWER
No, here it is. Sit, cousin Percy
Sit, good cousin Hotspur, for by that name
As oft as Lancaster doth speak of you
His cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh
He wisheth you in heaven.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
And you in hell,
As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
</T>
<T>
GLENDOWER
I cannot blame him. At my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
Of burning cressets, and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Shaked like a coward.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Why, so it would have done
At the same season if your mothers cat
Had but kittened, though yourself had never been born.
</T>
<T>
GLENDOWER
I say the earth did shake when I was born.
</T>
<T>
KING
Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,
For we shall presently have need of you.
</T>
<T>
I know not whether God will have it so
For some displeasing service I have done,
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
Hell breed revengement and a scourge for me.
But thou dost in thy passages of life
Make me believe that thou art only marked
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
Could such inordinate and low desires,
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
Such barren pleasures, rude society
As thou art matched withal, and grafted to,
Accompany the greatness of thy blood,
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
So please your Majesty, I would I could
Quit all offenses with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal.
Yet such extenuation let me beg
As, in reproof of many tales devised,
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers,
I may for some things true, wherein my youth
Hath faulty wandered and irregular,
Find pardon on my true submission.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action?Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs aboutme like an like an old ladys loose gown. I am withered likean old applejohn. Well, Ill repent, and that suddenly, whileI am in some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and thenI shall have no strength to repent. An I have not forgottenwhat the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn,a brewers horse. The inside of a church! Company,villanous company, hath been the spoil of me.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Why, there is it. Come sing me a bawdy song, make memerry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be,virtuous enough: swore little; diced not above seven timesa week; went to a bawdy house once in a quarterof anhour; paid money that I borrowed, three or four times; livedwell and in good compass; and now I live out of all order, outof all compass.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out ofall compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Do thou amend thy face, and Ill amend my life. Thou art ouradmiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop, but tis in thenose of thee. Thou art the knight of the burning lamp.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Well said, my noble Scot. If speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery,
Such attribution should the Douglas have
As not a soldier of this seasons stamp
Should go so general current through the world.
By God, I cannot flatter. I do defy
The tongues of soothers. But a braver place
In my hearts love hath no man than yourself.
Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
Thou art the king of honor.
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Do so, and tis well.
</T>
<T>
What letters hast thou there? (to DOUGLAS) I can but thank you.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
These letters come from your father.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
He cannot come, my lord. He is grievous sick.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry. Fill me a bottle ofsack. Our soldiers shall march through. Well to SuttonColdfield tonight.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
Will you give me money, captain?
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
Lay out, lay out.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
This bottle makes an angel.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
An if it do, take it for thy labor. An if it make twenty, takethem all. Ill answer the coinage. Bid my lieutenant Petomeet me at towns end.
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
I will, captain. Farewell.
</T>
<T>
FALSTAFF
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet. Ihave misused the Kings press damnably. I have got, inexchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers, three hundred andodd pounds. I press me none but good householders,yeomens sons; inquire me out contracted bachelors, such ashad been asked twice on the banns; such a commodity ofwarm slavesas had as lief hear the devil as a drum, suchas fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or ahurt wild duck. I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter,with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads, and
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Well fight with him tonight.
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
It may not be.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
You give him then advantage.
</T>
<T>
VERNON
Not a whit.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
Why say you so? Looks he not for supply?
</T>
<T>
VERNON
So do we.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
His is certain; ours is doubtful.
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
Good cousin, be advised. Stir not tonight.
</T>
<T>
VERNON
(to HOTSPUR) Do not, my lord.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
You do not counsel well.
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
</T>
<T>
VERNON
Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life
(And I dare well maintain it with my life),
If well-respected honor bid me on,
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
Which of us fears.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
Yea, or tonight.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this seald brief
With winged haste to the Lord Marshal,
This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
To whom they are directed. If you knew
How much they do import, you would make haste.
</T>
<T>
SIR MICHAEL
My good lord, I guess their tenor.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Like enough you do.
Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch. For, sir, at Shrewsbury,
As I am truly given to understand,
The King with mighty and quick-raisd power
Meets with Lord Harry. And I fear, Sir Michael,
What with the sickness of Northumberland,
Whose power was in the first proportion,
And what with Owen Glendowers absence thence,
Who with them was a rated sinew too
And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the King.
</T>
<T>
SIR MICHAEL
Why, my good lord, you need not fear.
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
No, Mortimer is not there.
</T>
<T>
SIR MICHAEL
But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
</T>
<T>
KING
How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill. The day looks pale
At his distemp'rature.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
Foretells a tempest and a blust'ring day.
</T>
<T>
KING
Then with the losers let it sympathize,
For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
</T>
<T>
How now, my Lord of Worcester? 'Tis not well
That you and I should meet upon such terms
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust
And made us doff our easy robes of peace
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.
This is not well, my lord; this is not well.
What say you to it? Will you again unknit
This curlish knot of all-abhorrd war
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light,
And be no more an exhaled meteor,
A prodigy of fear and a portent
Of broachd mischief to the unborn times?
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
The liberal and kind offer of the King.
</T>
<T>
VERNON
'Twere best he did.
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
Then are we all undone.
It is not possible, it cannot be
The King should keep his word in loving us.
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offense in other faults.
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,
For treason is but trusted like the fox,
Who, never so tame, so cherished and locked up,
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
Interpretation will misquote our looks,
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
The better cherished still the nearer death.
My nephews trespass may be well forgot;
It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
And an adopted name of privilege
A hairbrained Hotspur governed by a spleen:
All his offenses live upon my head
And on his fathers. We did train him on,
And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
We as the spring of all shall pay for all.
Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know
In any case the offer of the King.
</T>
<T>
VERNON
Deliver what you will; Ill say tis so.
</T>
<T>
BLUNT
What is thy name that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek
Upon my head?
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
Know then, my name is Douglas,
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king.
</T>
<T>
BLUNT
They tell thee true.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
</T>
<T>
BLUNT
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Lord Staffords death.
</T>
<T>
HOTSPUR
O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
I never had triumphed upon a Scot.
</T>
<T>
DOUGLAS
Alls done, alls won; here breathless lies the King.
</T>
<T>
KING
I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself. Thou bleedest too much.
Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
</T>
<T>
LANCASTER
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
I beseech your Majesty, make up,
Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
</T>
<T>
KING
I will do so.My Lord of Westmoreland,
Lead him to his tent.
</T>
<T>
WESTMORELAND
Come, my lord, Ill lead you to your tent.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help,
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
Where stained nobility lies trodden on,
And rebels' arms triumph in massacres.
</T>
<T>
LANCASTER
We breathe too long. Come, cousin Westmoreland,
Our duty this way lies. For Gods sake, come.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,
But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
</T>
<T>
KING
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,
Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsmans trust?
Three knights upon our party slain today,
A noble earl, and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour,
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
</T>
<T>
WORCESTER
What I have done my safety urged me to.
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
</T>
<T>
KING
Bear Worcester to the death, and Vernon too.
Other offenders we will pause upon.
</T>
<T>
How goes the field?
</T>
<T>
PRINCE HENRY
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turned from him,
The noble Percy slain, and all his men
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,
And, falling from a hill, he was so bruised
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is, and I beseech your Grace
I may dispose of him.
</T>
