FIRST WITCH
When shall we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
When the hurly-burlys done,
When the battles lost and won.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
That will be ere the set of sun.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Where the place?
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Upon the heath.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
There to meet with Macbeth.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
I come, Graymalkin!
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Paddock calls.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
Anon.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Fair is foul, and foul is fair
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
</T>
<T>
CAPTAIN
Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon himfrom the Western Isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,
And fortune, on his damnd quarrel smiling,
Showed like a rebels whore. But alls too weak,
For brave Macbethwell he deserves that name
Disdaining fortune, with his brandished steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valors minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,
And fixed his head upon our battlements.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Where hast thou been, sister?
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Killing swine.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
Sister, where thou?
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
A sailors wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munched, and munched, and munched. Give me,
quoth I.
Aroint thee, witch! the rump-fed runnion cries.
Her husbands to Aleppo gone, master o' th' Tiger;
But in a sieve Ill thither sail,
And like a rat without a tail,
Ill do, Ill do, and Ill do.
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Ill give thee a wind.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Thou 'rt kind.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
And I another.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' th' shipmans card.
Ill drain him dry as hay.
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid.
He shall live a man forbid.
Weary sev'nnights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
Those in commission yet returned?
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die, who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon, and set forth
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it. He died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
As twere a careless trifle.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
Theres no art
To find the minds construction in the face.
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust.
</T>
<T>
(to MACBETH) O worthiest cousin,
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
More is thy due than more than all can pay.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
(reading) They met me in the day of success, and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the king, who all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor,' by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time with 'Hail, king that shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.
</T>
<T>
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' th' milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great,
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries, Thus thou must do, if thou have it,
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,
Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crowned withal.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat. The air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heavens breath
Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.
</T>
<T>
DUNCAN
See, see, our honored hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
All our service,
In every point twice done and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house. For those of old,
And the late dignities heaped up to them,
We rest your hermits.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
If it were done when tis done, then twere well
It were done quickly. If the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
Wed jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here, that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague th' inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips. Hes here in double trust:
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked newborn babe,
Striding the blast, or heavens cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on th' other.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
How goes the night, boy?
</T>
<T>
FLEANCE
The moon is down. I have not heard the clock.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
And she goes down at twelve.
</T>
<T>
FLEANCE
I take t tis later, sir.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
Hold, take my sword. Theres husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursd thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose.
</T>
<T>
Give me my sword. Whos there?
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
A friend.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
What, sir, not yet at rest? The kings a-bed.
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
In measureless content.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect,
Which else should free have wrought.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.
What hath quenched them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace! It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the sternst good-night. He is about it.
The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugged their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
(within)Whos there? What, ho!
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And tis not done. Th' attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done t.
</T>
<T>
My husband!
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
When?
</T>
<T>
PORTER
Heres a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell-gate,he should have old turning the key.
</T>
<T>
Knock, knock, knock! Whos there, i' th' name of Beelzebub? Heres a farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty. Come in time, have napkins enough about you, here youll sweat for t.
</T>
<T>
Knock, knock! Whos there, in th' other devils name? Faith, heres an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for Gods sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in, equivocator.
</T>
<T>
Knock, knock, knock! Whos there? Faith, heres an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here you may roast your goose.
</T>
<T>
OLD MAN
Threescore and ten I can remember well,
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings.
</T>
<T>
ROSS
Ha, good father,
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with mans act,
Threatens his bloody stage. By th' clock tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.
Is t nights predominance or the days shame
That darkness does the face of Earth entomb
When living light should kiss it?
</T>
<T>
OLD MAN
'Tis unnatural,
Even like the deed thats done. On Tuesday last,
A falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.
</T>
<T>
ROSS
And Duncans horsesa thing most strange and certain
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would
Make war with mankind.
</T>
<T>
OLD MAN
'Tis said they eat each other.
</T>
<T>
ROSS
They did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes
That looked upon t. Here comes the good Macduff.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and I fear
Thou playedst most foully for t. Yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Heres our chief guest.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
And Ill request your presence.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
Let your highness
Command upon me, to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
Forever knit.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
Is Banquo gone from court?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
Say to the king I would attend his leisure
For a few words.
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
Madam, I will.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
Naughts had, alls spent,
Where our desire is got without content.
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
</T>
<T>
How now, my lord! Why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard. Whats done is done.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
Shell close and be herself whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.
After lifes fitful fever he sleeps well.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
Can touch him further.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MURDERER
But who did bid thee join with us?
</T>
<T>
THIRD MURDERER
Macbeth.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MURDERER
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MURDERER
Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.
Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
The subject of our watch.
</T>
<T>
THIRD MURDERER
Hark, I hear horses.
</T>
<T>
BANQUO
(within) Give us a light there, ho!
</T>
<T>
SECOND MURDERER
Then tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' th' court.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MURDERER
His horses go about.
</T>
<T>
THIRD MURDERER
Almost a mile; but he does usually
So all men dofrom hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
You know your own degrees; sit down. At first
And last, the hearty welcome.
</T>
<T>
LORDS
Thanks to your majesty.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACBETH
Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
For my heart speaks they are welcome.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even. Here Ill sit i' th' midst.
Be large in mirth. Anon well drink a measure
The table round.
</T>
<T>
(aside to FIRST MURDERER) Theres blood upon thy face.
</T>
<T>
FIRST MURDERER
'Tis Banquos then.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatched?
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Why, how now, Hecate! You look angerly.
</T>
<T>
HECATE
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death,
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never called to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And, which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now. Get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i' th' morning. Thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and everything beside.
I am for the air. This night Ill spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon.
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.
Ill catch it ere it come to ground.
And that distilled by magic sleights
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
</T>
<T>
LENNOX
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
Which can interpret farther. Only I say
Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
Was pitied of Macbeth. Marry, he was dead.
And the right-valiant Banquo walked too late,
Whom, you may say, if t please you, Fleance killed,
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father? Damnd fact!
How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,
For twould have angered any heart alive
To hear the men deny t. So that, I say,
He has borne all things well. And I do think
That had he Duncans sons under his key
As, ant please heaven, he shall notthey should find
What twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.
But, peace! For from broad words, and 'cause he failed
His presence at the tyrants feast, I hear
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
Where he bestows himself?
</T>
<T>
LORD
The son of Duncan
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy king upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,
That by the help of thesewith Him above
To ratify the workwe may again
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
Do faithful homage and receive free honors.
All which we pine for now. And this report
Hath so exasperated the king that he
Prepares for some attempt of war.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed.
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.
</T>
<T>
THIRD WITCH
Harpier cries, 'Tis time, tis time.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WITCH
Round about the cauldron go,
In the poisoned entrails throw.
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Sweltered venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i' th' charmd pot.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Double, double toil and trouble,
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
</T>
<T>
SECOND WITCH
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake.
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adders fork and blind-worms sting,
Lizards leg and owlets wing,
For a charm of powerful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Double, double toil and trouble,
Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACDUFF
What had he done to make him fly the land?
</T>
<T>
ROSS
You must have patience, madam.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACDUFF
He had none.
His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.
</T>
<T>
ROSS
You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
</T>
<T>
LADY MACDUFF
Wisdom! To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
He wants the natural touch. For the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear and nothing is the love,
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.
</T>
<T>
ROSS
My dearest coz,
I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' th' season. I dare not speak much further;
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and none. I take my leave of you.
Shall not be long but Ill be here again.
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before.My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,
Bestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out
Like syllable of dolor.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
What I believe Ill wail;
What know believe, and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest. You have loved him well.
He hath not touched you yet. I am young, but something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
T' appease an angry god.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
I am not treacherous.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
I have two nights watched with you but can perceive notruth in your report. When was it she last walked?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEWOMAN
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this whilein a most fast sleep.
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the line>effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and otheractual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEWOMAN
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
You may to me, and tis most meet you should.
</T>
<T>
GENTLEWOMAN
Neither to you nor any one, having no witness to confirm my speech.
</T>
<T>
Lo you, here she comes. This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her, stand close.
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
How came she by that light?
</T>
<T>
MENTEITH
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff.
Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man.
</T>
<T>
ANGUS
Near Birnam Wood
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
</T>
<T>
CAITHNESS
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
</T>
<T>
LENNOX
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file
Of all the gentry. There is Siwards son,
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood.
</T>
<T>
MENTEITH
What does the tyrant?
</T>
<T>
CAITHNESS
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
Some say hes mad, others that lesser hate him
Do call it valiant fury. But, for certain,
He cannot buckle his distempered cause
Within the belt of rule.
</T>
<T>
ANGUS
Now does he feel
His secret murders sticking on his hands.
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.
Those he commands move only in command,
Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
Hang loose about him, like a giants robe
Upon a dwarfish thief.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Bring me no more reports. Let them fly all.
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. Whats the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
Fear not, Macbeth. No man thats born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee. Then fly, false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures.
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
</T>
<T>
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where gotst thou that goose look?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
There is ten thousand
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Geese, villain?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
Soldiers, sir.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Go, prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-livered boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
</T>
<T>
SERVANT
The English force, so please you.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Take thy face hence.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.
</T>
<T>
MENTEITH
We doubt it nothing.
</T>
<T>
SIWARD
What wood is this before us?
</T>
<T>
MENTEITH
The wood of Birnam.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear t before him. Thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.
</T>
<T>
SOLDIERS
It shall be done.
</T>
<T>
SIWARD
We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
Our setting down before t.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
'Tis his main hope:
For, where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constraind things
Whose hearts are absent too.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Hang out our banners on the outward walls.
The cry is still They come! Our castles strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up.
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
</T>
<T>
What is that noise?
</T>
<T>
SEYTON
It is the cry of women, my good lord.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
The time has been my senses would have cooled
To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in t. I have supped full with horrors.
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me.
</T>
<T>
Wherefore was that cry?
</T>
<T>
SEYTON
The queen, my lord, is dead.
</T>
<T>
MALCOLM
Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw down,
And show like those you are.You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon s what else remains to do,
According to our order.
</T>
<T>
SIWARD
Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrants power tonight,
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
They have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,
But, bearlike, I must fight the course. Whats he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.
</T>
<T>
YOUNG SIWARD
What is thy name?
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.
</T>
<T>
YOUNG SIWARD
No, though thou callst thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
My names Macbeth.
</T>
<T>
YOUNG SIWARD
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
No, nor more fearful.
</T>
<T>
YOUNG SIWARD
Thou liest, abhorrd tyrant. With my sword
Ill prove the lie thou speakst.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandished by man thats of a woman born.
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
Turn, hellhound, turn!
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Of all men else I have avoided thee.
But get thee back. My soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
I have no words.
My voice is in my sword. Thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!
</T>
<T>
MACBETH
Thou losest labor.
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmd life, which must not yield
To one of woman born.
</T>
<T>
MACDUFF
Despair thy charm,
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mothers womb
Untimely ripped.
</T>
