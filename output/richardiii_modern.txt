RICHARD
Now all of my familys troubles have come to a glorious end, thanks to my brother, King Edward IV. All the clouds that threatened the York family have vanished and turned to sunshine. Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads. Weve taken off our armor and weapons and hung them up as decorations. Instead of hearing trumpets call us to battle, we dance at parties. We get to wear easy smiles on our faces rather than the grim expressions of war. Instead of charging toward our enemies on armored horses, we dance for our ladies in their chambers, accompanied by sexy songs on the lute. But Im not made to be a seducer, or to make faces at myself in the mirror. I was badly made and dont have the looks to strut my stuff in front of pretty sluts. Ive been cheated of a nice body and face, or even normal proportions. I am deformed, spit out from my mothers womb prematurely and so badly formed that dogs bark at me as I limp by them. Im left with nothing to do in this weak, idle peacetime, unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about that.
</T>
<T>
Since I cant amuse myself by being a lover, Ive decided to become a villain. Ive set dangerous plans in motion, using lies, drunken prophecies, and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other. If King Edward is as honest and fair-minded as I am deceitful and cruel, then Clarence is going to be locked away in prison today because of a prophecy that GEdward interprets G to mean George, Duke of Clarence, though ironically it could just as well mean Richard, Duke of Gloucester.G will murder Edwards children. Oh, time to hide what Im thinkinghere comes Clarence.
</T>
<T>
Good afternoon, brother. Why are you surrounded by these armed guards?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the TowerThe Tower of London, where political prisoners were kept.Tower.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Youre being arrested? Why?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Because my name is George.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Thats not your fault! He should imprison the person who named you, instead. Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed. But, really, whats going on, Clarence? Can you tell me?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Ill tell you as soon as I know, Richard, because at this point I have no idea. All Ive been able to find out is that our brother the king has been listening to prophecies and dreams. He picked out the letter G from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that G will take the throne away from his children. He thinks G is me. Ive learned that this, along with other frivolous reasons like it, is what prompted the king to send me to prison.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Well, this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women. The king isnt the one sending you to the Tower, Clarence. Its his wife, Lady Grey, who got him to do this. Remember how she and her brother, Anthony Woodeville, made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower? Hastings was just released. Were not safe, Clarence, were not safe.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
By God, I think the only people who are safe are the queens own relatives and the late-night messengers the king uses to fetch his mistress, Mistress Shore. Did you hear how Lord Hastings had to beg the queen to be freed?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Hastings got his freedom by bowing down to that goddess. And Ill tell you what. If we want to stay in the kings good graces, were going have to act like the mistresssRichard implies that Mistress Shore and the queen did not belong to the rank of gentry.mistresss servants, too. Ever since our brother made them gentlewomen, Mistress Shore and the queen have become mighty busybodies in our kingdom.
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
I beg your pardon, my lords, but the king gave me orders that no one, however high in rank, should speak privately to Clarence.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
All right. If you like, Brakenbury, you can listen to anything we say. Were not saying anything treasonous, man. We say the king is wise and good, and his noble queen is getting old, pretty, and not jealous. And that Mr. Shores wife has nice feet, cherry lips, pretty eyes, and a very pleasant way of expressing herself. And, finally, that the queens relatives have all been elevated in rank. What do you think? Is there anything inaccurate in that?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
I have nothing to do with what youre talking about, my lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Nothing to do with Mrs. Shore! I tell you, mister, theres only one man who gets to do nothing,To do nothing, or naught, meant to have sex. Richard is playing off Brakenburys innocent, frightened remark.nothing, with her and not be punished for it. Everyone else had better keep their nothings to themselves.
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
Who is that, my lord?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Her husband, you rascal. Are you going to get me in trouble?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
I beg your GraceGrace is a title of address for nobility and royalty and might apply to a king, queen, duke, duchess, or archbishop.Grace to pardon me, and now please stop talking to Clarence.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
We know you have a job to do, Brakenbury, and well do what you say.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
We are required to serve the queen, and we must obey her. Farewell, brother. I will go to the king and do whatever you want me to, even if its to call my brothers wife sister, in order to set you free. But just so you know, I am very angry about how our own brother has treated you, angrier than you can imagine.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
It doesnt make either of us happy, I know.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Well, your imprisonment wont last long. I will either get you out, lying if I have to, or stay in prison in your place. In the meantime, be patient.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
I have no choice. Goodbye.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Go walk the path that you will never return from. Dumb, honest Clarence. I love you so much that Ill send your soul to heaven very soonif heaven will accept anything from me, that is. But whos coming? The newly released Hastings?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Good afternoon, my dear lord!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
The same to you, my lord! Welcome to the open air again. How did you tolerate prison?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must. But I will live to thank those who sent me there.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
No doubt, no doubt. And so will Clarence, for your enemies are his enemies, and they have gotten the upper hand of him as well as of you.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Its a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Whats the news abroad?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
No news as bad as the news at home: The king is sickly, weak, and depressed, and his doctors are very afraid hes going to die
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Now, by George, that really is terrible news. Oh, the king has abused his body with bad habits for a long time, and its finally taking its toll on him. Very sad. Where is he, in his bed?
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
He is.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
You go ahead, and I will follow you.
</T>
<T>
The king wont live, I hope. But hed better not die till Clarence is sent packing to heaven. Ill go see the king and, with carefully argued lies, get him to hate Clarence even more than he already does. If my plan succeeds, Clarence doesnt have another day to live. Then Gods free to send King Edward to heaven, too, and leave me the world to run around in! Ill marry the earl of Warwicks youngest daughter, Lady Anne. So what if I killed her husband and her father? The best way to make up for the girls losses is to become what shes lost: a husband and a father. So thats what Ill do, not because I love her but because Ill get something out of it. But Im running ahead of myself. Clarence is still alive; Edward is not only alive, hes king. Only when theyre dead can I start to count my gains.
</T>
<T>
ANNE
Set down your honorable load, men, if there is ever any honor in being dead. I want to mourn the cruel death of this good man. Look at the noble kings poor cold bodythe measly remains of the Lancaster family.
</T>
<T>
His royal blood has drained right out of him. I hope I can talk to your ghost, Henry, without breaking church laws. I want you to hear my sorrow. My husbandAnnes husband was Prince Edward, King Henrys son and a Lancaster.husband was murdered by the same man who stabbed you. My tears now fall into the holes where your life leaked out. I curse the man who made these holes. I curse the mans heart who had the heart to stab you. And I curse the mans blood who shed your blood. I want the man who made me suffer by killing you to face a more terrible end than I could wish on spiders, toads, and all the poisonous, venomous things things alive. If he ever has a child, let it be born prematurely, and let it look like a monsterso ugly and unnatural that the sight of it frightens its own mother.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Be patient, madam. Im sure his majesty will recover his health soon.
</T>
<T>
GREY
Youll only make him worse with all your worry. For Gods sake, let people comfort you. Then youll be able to cheer him up.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
If he were dead, what would happen to me?
</T>
<T>
GREY
Nothing more than that youd lose your husband.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Losing this husband will cause me all sorts of harm.
</T>
<T>
GREY
You have been blessed with an excellent son, who will comfort you when the king is dead.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
But hes young, and as long as hes too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him. Richard loves neither me nor any of you.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Has it been decided that Richard will be ProtectorA Protector acted for a king until he was old enough to rule on his own.Protector?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Its been decided, though not yet officially announced. But thats what will happen if the king dies.
</T>
<T>
KEEPER
Why do you look so depressed today, your Grace?
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
Oh, I had a miserable night. I had such dark and terrifying dreams that I swear I wouldnt spend another night like that if it guaranteed me a whole lifetime of happy days.
</T>
<T>
KEEPER
What was your dream? Tell me.
</T>
<T>
CLARENCE
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard, who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him. Looking toward England, we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences wed had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters. As we were pacing the deck, which was tipping heavily, Richard seemed to stumble, and as I tried to grab hold of him and keep him from falling, he knocked me overboard into the crashing waves. Lord, how painful it was to drown. The sound of the rushing water was terrible, and so were the sights. I saw a thousand shipwrecks, a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone, huge anchors, chunks of gold, heaps of pearls, and precious jewelsall scattered on the bottom of the sea.
</T>
<T>
KING EDWARD IV
Well. Now Ive done a good days work. You must all keep up this united front. Every day I expect a message from God to bring me away from here. Now my soul can depart for heaven peacefully, since my friends have made peace here on earth. Rivers and Hastings, take each others hand. Dont simply hide your hatred. Swear your love for each other.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
(taking HASTINGSs hand) I swear I have cleansed my heart of all hate. With this handshake, I guarantee my love.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
On my honor, I feel the same.
</T>
<T>
KING EDWARD IV
Make sure you mean what you say. Otherwise God, the ultimate King, will uncover your lies and cause you to be the death of each other.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
On my honor, I swear I love Rivers with all my heart.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
And I love Hastings with all my heart.
</T>
<T>
BOY
Tell me, good grandmother, is our father dead?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
No, boy.
</T>
<T>
GIRL
Then why do you weep so often, and beat your breast, and cry, Oh Clarence, my unlucky son?
</T>
<T>
BOY
Why do you look at us and shake your head, and call us orphans, wretches, castaways, if our noble father is still alive?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
My pretty children, both of you misunderstand me. Im lamenting the sickness of the king, because Id hate to lose himIm not mourning your fathers death. What would be the point of crying over someone who was already dead?
</T>
<T>
BOY
So youre admitting Clarence, my father, is dead. My uncle the king is to blame for this. God will take revenge. I will pray every day that he does.
</T>
<T>
GIRL
And so will I.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Quiet, children, quiet. The king loves you very much. Innocent sweethearts, you have no idea whos responsible for your fathers death.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
Im telling you, I hardly know myself. Did you hear the news thats going around?
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Yes, that the king is dead.
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
Bad news, by God. The news is always bad. But this news is bound to make the world go mad.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Neighbors, hello.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
Good day to you, sir.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Is it true that good King Edward has died?
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
Yes, sir, its all too true, God help us.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Then, gentlemen, we can count on trouble.
</T>
<T>
FIRST CITIZEN
No, no, with Gods help, his son will be king.
</T>
<T>
THIRD CITIZEN
Its bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
</T>
<T>
SECOND CITIZEN
His counselors will govern as long as hes a minor, and then hell take over. It shouldnt go so badly.
</T>
<T>
ARCHBISHOP
Last night, I hear, they stayed in Stony Stratford. Tonight they will rest in Northhampton. Theyll be here tomorrow or the next day.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Im dying to see the prince. I hope hes grown a lot since I last saw him.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
But I hear he hasnt. They say my son York has almost passed him in height.
</T>
<T>
YORK
Yes, mother, but I wish I hadnt.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Why, dear child? Its good to grow.
</T>
<T>
YORK
Grandmother, one night when we were eating dinner, my uncle Rivers mentioned that I had grown more than my brother. Yes, said my uncle Gloucester, Small plants are graceful, while ugly weeds grow fast. And since then, Ive wished I wouldnt grow so fast, because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Well, it certainly wasnt true for Richard! As a child, he took such a long time to grow up that, according to his rule, he should have grown up into a gracious adult.
</T>
<T>
YORK
And no doubt he is, gracious madam.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, the capital of the king.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Welcome, dear nephew, king of all my thoughts. The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy.
</T>
<T>
PRINCE
It wasnt the journey itself, uncle, but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull. I want more uncles here to welcome me.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Sweet prince, youre just an innocent child. You dont really understand how capable people are of trickery. All you know is what a man shows you, which has little to do with what hes really thinking. Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous. Your Grace heard their saccharine words, but didnt take note of their poisonous intentions. God protect you from them and from other false friends!
</T>
<T>
PRINCE
God should keep me from false friends, but they werent false.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
My lord, the mayor of London is here to greet you.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
(knocking) My lord, my lord.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
(offstage) Whos knocking?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
A messenger from Lord Stanley.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
(offstage)What time is it?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Four o'clock in the morning.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Cant Lord Stanley sleep?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
I guess notfor good reason, as youll soon hear. First, he sends his regards.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
And then?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
And then he said to tell you that tonight he dreamed the duke of Gloucester cut off his helmetthat is, his head. Besides that, he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow, and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him, who are at the other, sorry. He wants to know if instead of going to the meeting, youll get on your horse and ride north with him to get out of harms way.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell you this. Today you will witness a person die for truth, duty, and loyality.
</T>
<T>
GREY
(to RATCLIFFE) God protect the prince from all of you. Youre a group of damned bloodsuckers!
</T>
<T>
VAUGHAN
(to RATCLIFFE) Youll live to regret this.
</T>
<T>
RATCLIFFE
Hurry up. Your lives are over.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
Oh, Pomfret, Pomfret! Oh, you bloody prison, fatal and threatening to noble lords! Within these guilty walls, Richard II was hacked to death. And now, to add more blood to its name, were losing our innocent lives here.
</T>
<T>
GREY
Now Margarets curse has fallen on our heads, for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son.
</T>
<T>
RIVERS
She cursed Richard then. She cursed Buckingham then. She cursed Hastings then. Oh God, remember to hear her prayer for them, just as for us! But dont kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Now, noble lords, the reason were meeting is to determine the day the prince will be crowned. In Gods name, speak. When should the royal day be?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Is everything ready for that event?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
It is. All we have to do is name the day.
</T>
<T>
ELY
Tomorrows a good day.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks? Whos closest to him?
</T>
<T>
ELY
You, I think, would best know what hes thinking.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
We know each others faces, but as for our thoughts, he doesnt know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or hisor you do about mine. Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
</T>
<T>
HASTINGS
Thank you. I know he holds me dear, but I havent asked him about the coronation, and he hasnt told me. But you, my noble lords, may name a time, and Ill second it on the dukes behalf, which I dont think hell mind.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Tell me, cousin, I need to know if you can shake like youve got a fever, turn pale all of a sudden, and stop speaking in the middle of a wordas if you were driven crazy with fear.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Oh please, I can imitate the best tragic actor around. I can speak and then look all around, and tremble, and start at a mere piece of straw as if I were paranoid. Frightening looks are also at my service, as are fake smiles. Anytime I need them, theyre waiting to do my bidding. But has Catesby gone?
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
He has. But here he is, back with the mayor.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Lord Mayor
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Watch out for the drawbridgeRichard and Buckingham are pretending they are under attack.drawbridge over there!
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Listen! A drum!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Catesby, look over the top of these walls to see if anyones there.
</T>
<T>
SCRIVENER
Heres the indictment of the good Lord Hastings, which has been written out in a clear hand, like any legal document, so it can be read aloud in public outside St. Pauls Cathedral. And look how well this sequence of events holds together: after Catesby brought the indictment to me last night, I spent eleven hours copying it. The original took just as long to write out. So thats twenty-two hours. And yet five hours ago, Lord Hastings was alive, untouched, free, at liberty. What a backward world we live in! Why, whos so stupid that he cant see through this fraud? But whos so blind to the consequences of speaking out that hell admit what he knows? The world is a bad place, where you cant speak what you know.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
So what did the citizens say?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Its incrediblethey didnt say a word.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Did you mention that Edwards children are bastards?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
I did. I talked about how he was engaged to Lady LucyEdward IV was engaged to Elizabeth Lucy and had a child with her before he married Elizabeth Grey.Lady Lucy, and how he was engaged to Lady BonaEdward sent Warwick to secure this French marriage and then backed out of it.Lady Bonathrough the help of the earl of Warwick. I spoke of the unquenchable greediness of Edwards desires and the way he forced himself on the wives of Londoners. I mentioned the way he punished people harshly for minor offenses. I said he was not the son of the noble duke of York, because your father was in France when he was conceived, which explains why he doesnt have anything in common with his father. And then I suggested that you were the spitting image of your father, both in the way you look and in the nobleness of your character. I went into all your victories in Scotland, your skill as a warrior, your wisdom in peacetime, your generosity, your goodness, and your exceptional modesty. Indeed, I left nothing out. And when my oration came to a close, I asked those who loved their country to cry, God save Richard, Englands royal king!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
And did they?
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Whos this? My granddaughter, with her kind aunt, the duchess of Gloucester, leading her by the hand? Now, on my life, the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes, whom she adores. Daughter, how nice to see you.
</T>
<T>
ANNE
Good afternoon!
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
The same to you, good sister. Where are you going?
</T>
<T>
ANNE
Just to the TowerIm guessing, for the same reason you are: to salute the noble princes who are staying there.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Yes, kind sister. We can all go together.
</T>
<T>
And here comes the warden, just in time. Officer, please tell us, if you will, how are the prince and my little son, York?
</T>
<T>
BRAKENBURY
Theyre just fine, my dear madam. But Im sorryIm not allowed to let you visit them. The king has strictly forbidden it.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Everyone stand aside.Cousin Buckingham.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
My gracious king.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Give me your hand.
</T>
<T>
Because of your advice and your help, I have a high position now. But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Let them last forever.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Oh Buckingham, now Im going to test to see if youre truly made of gold. Young Prince Edward is still alivewhat do you think Im going to say next?
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Go on, my loving lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Why, Buckingham, I say I want to be king.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Why, you are king, your highness.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Ha! Am I king? I guess I am. But Edward is still alive.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
True, noble prince.
</T>
<T>
TYRREL
The tyrants bloody request has been met. It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of. Dighton and Forrest, whom I hired to perform the butchery, are used to killing people, the bloody dogs. But they melted with tenderness and human compassion, weeping like children, when they described what theyd done. The tender babes lay like this, said Dighton. Like this, said Forrest, with their innocent white arms around each other. Their lips, like four red roses on a stalk, touched. A prayer book lay on their pillow, which said Forrest, almost made me change my mind. But, oh, the devilthere he stopped talking and Dighton took up where he left off: We smothered the perfect, most sweet work of nature. The two men were both destroyed by remorse. They couldnt speak. So I left them to bring the news to the murderous king. And here he comes.
</T>
<T>
Here he comes.Health to you, my king.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Kind Tyrrel, will your news make me happy?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
So now the good times have ripened and grown rotten. Ive lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies. Ive been watching the terrible prologue to a scene that I hope will prove dark and tragic. Ill head to France soon. Its time to hide, wretched Margaret. Whos coming?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ELIZABETH
Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes, my flowers who didnt even get a chance to bloom. If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever, hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mothers lament.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved, with her children dead before their time.
</T>
<T>
DUCHESS
Ive been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute. Edward Plantagenet, why are you dead?
</T>
<T>
QUEEN MARGARET
(to herself) One Plantagenet pays for the other. One Edward dies to pay a debt for the other Edward who died.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
Sir Christopher, relay this message to Richmond: My son George Stanley is penned up in the bloody boars sty. If I revolt, off goes young Georges head. My fear of that prevents me from helping Richmond at this time. But, tell me, where is the noble Richmond now?
</T>
<T>
CHRISTOPHER
At Pembroke, or at Harfordwest in Wales.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
Which noblemen have joined him?
</T>
<T>
CHRISTOPHER
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; Sir Gilbert Talbot; Sir William Stanley; Oxford; the highly feared Pembroke; Sir James Blunt; Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew; and many other famous and powerful noblemen. They plan to head straight to London, assuming they dont encounter any resistance on the way.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
(giving him a paper) Return to your lord. Give him my best regards. Tell him the queen has given her heartfelt consent to his marriage to her daughter, Elizabeth. And these letters will let him know what my thinking is. Goodbye, and take care.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Wont King Richard let me speak with him?
</T>
<T>
SHERIFF
No, my good lord. So be calm.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Hastings and Edwards children, Rivers and Grey, holy King Henry and your fine son Edward, Vaughan, and all who have died from underhanded, corrupt, fiendish injustice, if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds, enjoy the revengelaugh at my ruin! This is All-SoulsA Catholic day of prayer for souls stuck in between Heaven and HellAll-Souls day, fellows, isnt it?
</T>
<T>
SHERIFF
It is, my lord.
</T>
<T>
BUCKINGHAM
Why, then, its my bodys doomsday. Today Im going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edwards children or his wifes allies. This is the day Im going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me. This, this All-Souls' day, is my just desserts. I tried to play games with God, and he turned my fake prayer on my head, giving me for real what Id asked for as a joke.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Fellow soldiers and my loyal friends suffering under that tyrant Richard, we have marched all the way to the center of England without encountering any opposition. And now we receive encouraging news from my stepfather Stanley: Richardthat violent, greedy boar who roots through your summer fields and ripening vines, guzzles your warm blood, and makes his trough in your disemboweled belliesis now near the town of Leicester, only one days march from us here in TamworthTamworth is in central England.Tamworth. In Gods name, lets continue on in high spirits, my courageous friends. Our aim is to achieve everlasting peace from this one violent war.

OXFORD
Every mans conscience is a thousand swords against this murderer.
</T>
<T>
HERBERT
I suspect his friends will join us.
</T>
<T>
BLUNT
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him. In his greatest need, even they will desert him.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
All to our advantage. So, in Gods name, lets march. Hope with good cause is swift; it flies as fast as a swallow. It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Lets pitch our tents right here in Bosworth Field. My Lord of Surrey, why do you look so sad?
</T>
<T>
SURREY
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
My Lord of Norfolk
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
Here, most gracious king.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Norfolk, were going to have a few blows, right?
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
Weve got to give them and take them, my lord.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Put my tent up! Ill lie here tonight. But where will I lie tomorrow? Well, it doesnt matter. Does anyone know the number of the enemys troops?
</T>
<T>
NORFOLK
Six or seven thousand, at most.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Why, our troops amount to three times that. Besides, the kings name is a tower of strength; the opposition doesnt have that advantage. Put up my tent! Come, noble gentlemen, let us look at our battle plan and get some experienced officers to help us figure out the best strategy. Lets be disciplined and not delay, because tomorrow is a busy day.

CATESBY
Help, my lord of Norfolk, help, help! The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible, challenging every enemy he sees. His horse is killed, so hes fighting on foot, risking his life to search out Richmond. Help, dear lord, or the battle will be lost!
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
A horse, a horse, Id give my kingdom for a horse!
</T>
<T>
CATESBY
Get off the field, my lord. Ill find you another horse.
</T>
<T>
RICHARD
Peasant, I have gambled my life on this one throw of the dice, and Im willing to take what comes. I think there are six Richmonds on the field. Ive killed five that looked like him, anyway. A horse, a horse! Id give my kingdom for a horse!
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
God and your work be praised, victorious friends. The day is ours. The bloody dog is dead.
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
(offering him the crown) Courageous Richmond, you fought well. Here, Ive taken back the stolen crown from that violent lowlife so it can grace your brows. Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Great God of heaven, say amen to all this! But, tell me, is young George Stanley alive?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester, where, if youd like, we can retreat to.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Which gentlemen on each side have been killed?
</T>
<T>
STANLEY
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
</T>
<T>
RICHMOND
Bury them in a manner appropriate to their noble births. Proclaim that Ill pardon the soldiers who fled if they will return and submit to my rule. As I vowed, I will unite the York and Lancaster families.
