<T>
PHILO
Nay, but this dotage of our generals
Oerflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
That oer the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captains heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gypsys lust.
</T>
<T>
Look where they come.
Take but good note, and you shall see in him
The triple pillar of the world transformed
Into a strumpets fool. Behold and see.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Theres beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Ill set a bourn how far to be beloved.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
News, my good lord, from Rome.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Grates me, the sum.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Nay, hear them, Antony.
Fulvia perchance is angry. Or who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you, Do this, or this.
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that.
Perform t, or else we damn thee.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
How, my love?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Perchance? Nay, and most like.
You must not stay here longer. Your dismission
Is come from Caesar. Therefore hear it, Antony.
Wheres Fulvias process? Caesars, I would sayboth?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypts queen,
Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
Is Caesars homager. Else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
Of the ranged empire fall. Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay. Our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life
Is to do thus, when such a mutual pair
And such a twain can do t, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
Ill seem the fool I am not. Antony
Will be himself.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
But stirred by Cleopatra.
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Lets not confound the time with conference harsh.
Theres not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Hear the ambassadors.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Fie, wrangling Queen!
Whom every thing becomesto chide, to laugh,
To weep, whose every passion fully strives
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
No messenger but thine, and all alone
Tonight well wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my Queen,
Last night you did desire it.(to the MESSENGER ) Speak not to us.
</T>
<T>
DEMETRIUS
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
</T>
<T>
PHILO
Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.
</T>
<T>
DEMETRIUS
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome, but I will hope
Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most anything Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, wheres the soothsayer that you praised so to th Queen? Oh that I knew this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns with garlands!
</T>
<T>
ALEXAS
Soothsayer!
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
Your will?
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
(to ALEXAS ) Is this the man? (to SOOTHSAYER ) Is t you, sir, that know things?
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
In natures infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.
</T>
<T>
ALEXAS
(to CHARMIAN )Show him your hand.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
(to servants within) Bring in the banquet quickly. Wine enough
Cleopatras health to drink.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
(giving hand to SOOTHSAYER ) Good sir, give me good fortune.
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
I make not, but foresee.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Pray, then, foresee me one.
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
(to the others) He means in flesh.
</T>
<T>
IRAS
No, you shall paint when you are old.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Wrinkles forbid!
</T>
<T>
ALEXAS
Vex not his prescience. Be attentive.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Hush!
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
You shall be more beloving than beloved.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Where is he?
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
I did not see him since.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
(to ALEXAS ) See where he is, whos with him, what he does.
I did not send you. If you find him sad,
Say I am dancing. If in mirth, report
That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
What should I do I do not?
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
In each thing give him way. Cross him in nothing.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Tempt him not so too far. I wish, forbear.
In time we hate that which we often fear.
</T>
<T>
But here comes Antony.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
I am sick and sullen.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Help me away, dear Charmian! I shall fall.
It cannot be thus long. The sides of nature
Will not sustain it.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Caesars natural vice to hate
Our great competitor. From Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
Vouchsafed to think he had partners. You shall find there
A man who is th abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
I must not think there are
Evils enough to darken all his goodness.
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by nights blackness, hereditary
Rather than purchased, what he cannot change
Than what he chooses.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
You are too indulgent. Lets grant, it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat. Say this becomes him
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemishyet must Antony
No way excuse his foils when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he filled
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
Call on him for t. But to confound such time
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours, tis to be chid
As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
And so rebel to judgment.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Charmian!
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Madam?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Ha, ha! Give me to drink mandragora.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Why, madam?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
You think of him too much.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Oh, tis treason!
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Madam, I trust, not so.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Thou, eunuch Mardian!
</T>
<T>
MARDIAN
Whats your highness pleasure?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has. Tis well for thee
That, being unseminared, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
</T>
<T>
MARDIAN
Yes, gracious madam.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Indeed?
</T>
<T>
MARDIAN
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done.
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
O Charmian,
Where thinkst thou he is now? Stands he or sits he?
Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse, for wottst thou whom thou movst?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. Hes speaking now,
Or murmuring Wheres my serpent of old Nile?
For so he calls me. Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus amorous pinches black
And wrinkled deep in time. Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch. And great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow.
There would he anchor his aspect, and die
With looking on his life.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
If the great gods be just, they shall assist
The deeds of justest men.
</T>
<T>
MENAS
Know, worthy Pompey,
That what they do delay, they not deny.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
The thing we sue for.
</T>
<T>
MENAS
We, ignorant of ourselves,
Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
Deny us for our good, so find we profit
By losing of our prayers.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
I shall do well.
The people love me, and the sea is mine.
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
Says it will come to th full. Mark Antony
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
No wars without doors. Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
Of both is flattered, but he neither loves,
Nor either cares for him.
</T>
<T>
MENAS
Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field. A mighty strength they carry.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Where have you this? Tis false.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Good Enobarbus, tis a worthy deed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
I shall entreat him
To answer like himself. If Caesar move him,
Let Antony look over Caesars head
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
Were I the wearer of Antonios beard,
I would not shave t today.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Tis not a time for private stomaching.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Every time serves for the matter that is then born in t.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
But small to greater matters must give way.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Not if the small come first.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Your speech is passion. But pray you stir
No embers up. Here comes the noble Antony.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
And yonder, Caesar.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
(to VENTIDIUS ) If we compose well here, to Parthia.
Hark, Ventidius.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
(to MECAENAS ) I do not know, Maecenas. Ask Agrippa.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
(to OCTAVIA ) The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom.
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIA
All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
(to CAESAR ) Good night, sir.My Octavia,
Read not my blemishes in the worlds report.
I have not kept my square, but that to come
Shall all be done by th rule. Good night, dear lady.
(to CAESAR ) Good night, sir.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Good night.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
If you can, your reason?
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue. But yet hie you to Egypt again.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Say to me whose fortunes shall rise higher,
Caesars or mine?
</T>
<T>
SOOTHSAYER
Caesars.
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
Thy dmonthat thy spirit which keeps theeis
Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable
Where Caesars is not. But near him thy angel
Becomes afeard, as being oerpowered. Therefore
Make space enough between you.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Trouble yourselves no further. Pray you, hasten
Your generals after.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Sir, Mark Antony
Will een but kiss Octavia, and well follow.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Till I shall see you in your soldiers dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.
</T>
<T>
MAECENAS
We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
Before you, Lepidus.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Your way is shorter.
My purposes do draw me much about.
Youll win two days upon me.
</T>
<T>
MAECENAS, AGRIPPA
Sir, good success.
</T>
<T>
LEPIDUS
Farewell.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Give me some music. Music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.
</T>
<T>
ALL
The music, ho!
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Let it alone. Lets to billiards. Come, Charmian.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
My arm is sore. Best play with Mardian.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
As well a woman with an eunuch played
As with a woman.Come, youll play with me, sir?
</T>
<T>
MARDIAN
As well as I can, madam.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
And when good will is showed, though t come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. Ill none now.
Give me mine angle. Well to th river. There,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finned fishes. My bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws, and as I draw them up
Ill think them every one an Antony
And say, Aha! Youre caught.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Twas merry when
You wagered on your angling, when your diver
Did hang a salt fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
That timeOh, times!
I laughed him out of patience, and that night
I laughed him into patience. And next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed,
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
Your hostages I have, so have you mine,
And we shall talk before we fight.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Most meet
That first we come to words, and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent,
Which, if thou hast considered, let us know
If twill tie up thy discontented sword
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here.
</T>
<T>
POMPEY
To you all three,
The senators alone of this great world,
Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want,
Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
There saw you laboring for him. What was t
That moved pale Cassius to conspire? And what
Made the all-honored, honest Roman Brutus,
With the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
To drench the Capitol, but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
The angered ocean foams, with which I meant
To scourge th ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SERVANT
Here theyll be, man. Some o their plants are ill-rooted already. The least wind i th world will blow them down.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SERVANT
Lepidus is high-colored.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SERVANT
They have made him drink alms-drink.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SERVANT
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he cries out, No more, reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th drink.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SERVANT
But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SERVANT
Why, this it is to have a name in great mens fellowship. I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SERVANT
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen to move in t, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o th Nile
By certain scales i th Pyramid. They know
By th height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells
The more it promises. As it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.
</T>
<T>
VENTIDIUS
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus death
Make me revenger. Bear the Kings sons body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
</T>
<T>
SILIUS
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony,
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.
</T>
<T>
VENTIDIUS
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough. A lower place, note well,
May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serves away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person. Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by th minute, lost his favor.
Who does i th wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captains captain; and ambition,
The soldiers virtue, rather makes choice of loss
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But twould offend him, and in his offense
Should my performance perish.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
What, are the brothers parted?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
They have dispatched with Pompey; he is gone.
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome. Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,
Since Pompeys feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the greensickness.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Tis a noble Lepidus.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
A very fine one. Oh, how he loves Caesar!
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Caesar? Why, hes the Jupiter of men.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Whats Antony? The god of Jupiter.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Spake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil!
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
O Antony, O thou Arabian bird!
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Would you praise Caesar, say Caesar. Go no further.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony.
Hoo! Hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, numberhoo!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Both he loves.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
They are his shards, and he their beetleShard-beetles make their home in dung heaps.their beetle.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Where is the fellow?
</T>
<T>
ALEXAS
Half afeard to come.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Go to, go to.Come hither, sir.
</T>
<T>
ALEXAS
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
That Herods head
Ill have! But how? When Antony is gone,
Through whom I might command it? (to MESSENGER ) Come thou near.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Most gracious majesty!
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Didst thou behold Octavia?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Ay, dread Queen.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Where?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Madam, in Rome.
I looked her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Is she as tall as me?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
She is not, madam.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Madam, I heard her speak. She is low-voiced.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Thats not so good. He cannot like her long.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that
That were excusable, that and thousands more
Of semblable importbut he hath waged
New wars gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear;
Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honor, cold and sickly
He vented them, most narrow measure lent me.
When the best hint was given him, he not took t,
Or did it from his teeth.
</T>
<T>
OCTAVIA
O my good lord,
Believe not all, or, if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, neer stood between,
Praying for both parts.
The good gods will mock me presently,
When I shall pray O bless my lord and husband!
Undo that prayer by crying out as loud
O bless my brother! Husband win, win brother
Prays and destroys the prayer; no midway
Twixt these extremes at all.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honor,
I lose myself; better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between s. The meantime, lady,
Ill raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
How now, friend Eros!
</T>
<T>
EROS
Theres strange news come, sir.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
What, man?
</T>
<T>
EROS
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
This is old. What is the success?
</T>
<T>
EROS
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars gainst Pompey, presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the glory of the action, and, not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal seizes him. So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more,
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
Theyll grind the one the other. Wheres Antony?
</T>
<T>
EROS
Hes walking in the garden(imitating anger) thus, and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, Fool Lepidus!
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murdered Pompey.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Our great navys rigged.
</T>
<T>
EROS
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius:
My lord desires you presently. My news
I might have told hereafter.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
In Alexandria. Heres the manner of t:
I th marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthroned. At the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my fathers son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute Queen.
</T>
<T>
MAECENAS
This in the public eye?
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
I th common showplace, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaimed the kings of kings:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assigned
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
In th habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appeared, and oft before gave audience,
As tis reported, so.
</T>
<T>
MAECENAS
Let Rome be thus informed.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Who, queasy with his insolence already,
Will their good thoughts call from him.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
But why, why, why?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars
And sayst it is not fit.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Well, is it, is it?
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Is t not denounced against us? Why should not we
Be there in person?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Well, I could reply,
If we should serve with horse and mares together,
The horse were merely lost. The mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
What is t you say?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,
Take from his heart, take from his brain, from s time
What should not then be spared. He is already
Traduced for levity, and tis said in Rome
That Photinus, an eunuch, and your maids
Manage this war.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Sink Rome! And their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i th war,
And as the president of my kingdom will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it.
I will not stay behind.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Taurus!
</T>
<T>
TAURUS
My lord?
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Strike not by land; keep whole. Provoke not battle
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll.
</T>
<T>
Our fortune lies
Upon this jump.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Set we our squadrons on yond side o th hill,
In eye of Caesars battle, from which place
We may the number of the ships behold
And so proceed accordingly.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
Th Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
To see t mine eyes are blasted.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Whats thy passion?
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance. We have kissed away
Kingdoms and provinces.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
How appears the fight?
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
On our side like the tokened pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt
Whom leprosy oertake!i th midst o th fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appeared
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The breeze upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
That I beheld.
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
Endure a further view.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Hark. The land bids me tread no more upon t.
It is ashamed to bear me. Friends, come hither.
I am so lated in the world that I
Have lost my way forever. I have a ship
Laden with gold. Take that, divide it. Fly
And make your peace with Caesar.
</T>
<T>
ALL
Fly? Not we.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, begone.
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you. Begone.
My treasures in the harbor. Take it. Oh,
I followed that I blush to look upon!
My very hairs do mutiny, for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, begone. You shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness. Take the hint
Which my despair proclaims. Let that be left
Which leaves itself. To the seaside straightway!
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little. Pray you now,
Nay, do so, for indeed I have lost command.
Therefore I pray you. Ill see you by and by.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Let him appear thats come from Antony.
Know you him?
</T>
<T>
DOLABELLA
Caesar, tis his schoolmaster
An argument that he is plucked, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Approach and speak.
</T>
<T>
AMBASSADOR
Such as I am, I come from Antony.
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
To his grand sea.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Be t so. Declare thine office.
</T>
<T>
AMBASSADOR
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt; which not granted,
He lessens his requests, and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
A private man in Athens. This for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
What shall we do, Enobarbus?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Think and die.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Is Antony or we in fault for this?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nicked his captainship at such a point
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The merd question. Twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Prithee, peace.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Is that his answer?
</T>
<T>
AMBASSADOR
Ay, my lord.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up?
</T>
<T>
AMBASSADOR
He says so.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Let her know t.
(to CLEOPATRA ) To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
He calls me boy and chides as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
He hath whipped with rods, dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die, meantime
Laugh at his challenge.
</T>
<T>
MAECENAS
Caesar must think
When one so great begins to rage, hes hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction. Never anger
Made good guard for itself.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Let our best heads
Know that tomorrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
Enough to fetch him in. See it done
And feast the army. We have store to do t,
And they have earned the waste. Poor Antony!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
He will not fight with me, Domitius?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
No.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Why should he not?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Tomorrow, soldier,
By sea and land Ill fight. Or I will live
Or bathe my dying honor in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woot thou fight well?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Ill strike and cry, Take all.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Well said. Come on!
Call forth my household servants.
</T>
<T>
Lets tonight
Be bounteous at our meal.
</T>
<T>
Give me thy hand.
Thou hast been rightly honest.So hast thou,
Thou,and thou,and thou. You have served me well,
And kings have been your fellows.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
(aside to ENOBARBUS ) What means this?
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
(aside to CLEOPATRA ) Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
Brother, good night. Tomorrow is the day.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
It will determine one way. Fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
Nothing. What news?
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
Belike tis but a rumor. Good night to you.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
Well, sir, good night.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
Soldiers, have careful watch.
</T>
<T>
THIRD SOLDIER
And you. Good night, good night.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
Here we. And if tomorrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
Tis a brave army, and full of purpose.
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
Peace! What noise?
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
List, list!
</T>
<T>
SECOND SOLDIER
Hark!
</T>
<T>
FIRST SOLDIER
Music i th air.
</T>
<T>
THIRD SOLDIER
Under the earth.
</T>
<T>
FOURTH SOLDIER
It signs well, does it not?
</T>
<T>
THIRD SOLDIER
No.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
(calling) Eros! Mine armor, Eros!
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Sleep a little.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
No, my chuck.Eros, come, mine armor, Eros!
</T>
<T>
Come, good fellow, put thine iron on.
If fortune be not ours today, it is
Because we brave her. Come.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Nay, Ill help too.
Whats this for?
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
The armorer of my heart. False, false. This, this.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Sooth, la, Ill help. Thus it must be.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Well, well,
We shall thrive now.Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defenses.
</T>
<T>
EROS
Briefly, sir.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Is not this buckled well?
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Rarely, rarely.
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To doff t for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my Queens a squire
More tight at this than thou. Dispatch.O love,
That thou couldst see my wars today, and knewst
The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see
A workman in t.
</T>
<T>
SOLDIER
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed
To make me fight at land!
</T>
<T>
SOLDIER
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Followed thy heels.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Whos gone this morning?
</T>
<T>
SOLDIER
Who?
One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus
He shall not hear thee, or from Caesars camp
Say I am none of thine.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
What sayest thou?
</T>
<T>
SOLDIER
Sir,
He is with Caesar.
</T>
<T>
EROS
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Is he gone?
</T>
<T>
SOLDIER
Most certain.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Go, Eros, send his treasure after. Do it.
Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him
I will subscribegentle adieus and greetings.
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. Oh, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.Enobarbus!
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
Our will is Antony be took alive.
Make it so known.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Caesar, I shall.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
The time of universal peace is near.
Prove this a prosprous day, the three-nooked world
Shall bear the olive freely.
</T>
<T>
MESSENGER
Antony
Is come into the field.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Alexas did revolt and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony, there did dissuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar
And leave his master Antony. For this pains
Caesar hath hanged him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment but
No honorable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
That I will joy no more.
</T>
<T>
AGRIPPA
Retire! We have engaged ourselves too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Thou bleedst apace.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now tis made an H.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
They do retire.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
Well beat em into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more.
</T>
<T>
EROS
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
Let us score their backs
And snatch em up, as we take hares, behind!
Tis sport to maul a runner.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
I will reward thee
Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold
For thy good valor. Come thee on.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
And let the Queen know of our gests.
</T>
<T>
Tomorrow,
Before the sun shall see s, well spill the blood
That has today escaped. I thank you all,
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
Not as you served the cause, but as t had been
Each mans like mine. You have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city. Clip your wives, your friends.
Tell them your feats, whilst they with joyful tears
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss
The honored gashes whole.
</T>
<T>
(to SCARUS ) Give me thy hand.
To this great fairy Ill commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o the world,
(to CLEOPATRA ) Chain mine armed neck. Leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing!
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, comst thou smiling from
The worlds great snare uncaught?
</T>
<T>
SENTRY
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to th court of guard. The night
Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
By th second hour i th morn.
</T>
<T>
FIRST WATCH
This last day was a shrewd one to s.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
O bear me witness, night
</T>
<T>
SECOND WATCH
What man is this?
</T>
<T>
FIRST WATCH
Stand close and list him.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
Be witness to me, O thou blessd moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent.
</T>
<T>
SENTRY
Enobarbus?
</T>
<T>
SECOND WATCH
Peace! Hark further.
</T>
<T>
ENOBARBUS
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular,
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive.
O Antony! O Antony!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Their preparation is today by sea.
We please them not by land.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
For both, my lord.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
I would theyd fight i th fire or i th air,
Wed fight there too. But this it is: our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us. Order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven,
Where their appointment we may best discover
And look on their endeavor.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
But being charged, we will be still by land
Which, as I take t, we shall, for his best force
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
And hold our best advantage.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Yet they are not joined. Where yond pine does stand
I shall discover all. Ill bring thee word
Straight how tis like to go.
</T>
<T>
SCARUS
Swallows have built
In Cleopatras sails their nests. The auguries
Say they know not, they cannot tell, look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
Is valiant and dejected, and by starts
His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
Of what he has and has not.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
All is lost!
This foul Egyptian hath betrayd me.
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turned whore! Tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly,
For when I am revenged upon my charm,
I have done all. Bid them all fly. Begone!
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Help me, my women! Oh, hes more mad
Than Telamon for his shield. The boar of Thessaly
Was never so embossed.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
To th monument!
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
To th monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself.
Say that the last I spoke was Antony,
And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death. (to the others) To th monument!
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Eros, thou yet beholdst me?
</T>
<T>
EROS
Ay, noble lord.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Sometimes we see a cloud thats dragonish,
A vapor sometime like a bear or lion,
A towered citadel, a pendant rock,
A forkd mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon t that nod unto the world
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs.
They are black vespers pageants.
</T>
<T>
EROS
Ay, my lord.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
As water is in water.
</T>
<T>
EROS
It does, my lord.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body. Here I am Antony,
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine
Which whilst it was mine had annexed unto t
A million more, now lostshe, Eros, has
Packed cards with Caesar and false-played my glory
Unto an enemys triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros. There is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
</T>
<T>
CHARMIAN
Be comforted, dear madam.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
No, I will not.
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise. Our size of sorrow,
Proportioned to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it.
</T>
<T>
How now? Is he dead?
</T>
<T>
DIOMEDES
His deaths upon him, but not dead.
Look out o th other side your monument.
His guard have brought him thither.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou movst in. Darkling stand
The varying shore o th world! O Antony,
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help!
Help, friends below! Lets draw him hither.
</T>
<T>
ANTONY
Peace!
Not Caesars valor hath oerthrown Antony,
But Antonys hath triumphed on itself.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony, but woe tis so!
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield.
Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks
The pauses that he makes.
</T>
<T>
DOLABELLA
Caesar, I shall.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
Wherefore is that? And what art thou that darst
Appear thus to us?
</T>
<T>
DERCETUS
I am called Dercetus.
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
Best to be served. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
He was my master, and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
Ill be to Caesar. If thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
What is t thou sayst?
</T>
<T>
DERCETUS
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
</T>
<T>
CAESAR
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack. The round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
Is not a single doom. In the name lay
A moiety of the world.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
My desolation does begin to make
A better life. Tis paltry to be Caesar.
Not being Fortune, hes but Fortunes knave,
A minister of her will. And it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
Which sleeps and never palates more the dung,
The beggars nurse, and Caesars.
</T>
<T>
PROCULEIUS
Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,
And bids thee study on what fair demands
Thou meanst to have him grant thee.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Whats thy name?
</T>
<T>
PROCULEIUS
My name is Proculeius.
</T>
<T>
CLEOPATRA
Antony
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but
I do not greatly care to be deceived,
That have no use for trusting. If your master
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
That majesty, to keep decorum, must
No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
To give me conquered Egypt for my son,
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks.
</T>
