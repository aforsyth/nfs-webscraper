Boatswain!
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Here, master. What cheer?
</T>
<T>
MASTER
Good, speak to th' mariners. Fall to t yarely, or we run ourselves aground. Bestir, bestir.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Heigh, my hearts! Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! Yare! Yare!
Take in the topsail.Tend to th' masters whistle.Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!
</T>
<T>
ALONSO
Good Boatswain, have care. Wheres the Master?
Play the men.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
I pray now, keep below.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
Where is the Master, Boatswain?
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Do you not hear him? You mar our labor. Keep your cabins.
You do assist the storm.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
Nay, good, be patient.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? To cabin, silence! Trouble us not.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
None that I more love than myself. You are a councilor. If you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope more. Use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.Cheerly, good hearts!Out of our way, I say.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
I have great comfort from this fellow. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him. His complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging. Make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth little advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Down with the topmast! Yare, lower, lower! Bring her to try wi' th' main course.
</T>
<T>
A plague upon this howling! They are louder than the weather or our office.
</T>
<T>
Yet again? What do you here? Shall we give o'er and drown?
Have you a mind to sink?
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Work you, then.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
Hang, cur! Hang, you whoreson insolent noisemaker! We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
Ill warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench.
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses off to sea again.
Lay her off!
</T>
<T>
MARINERS
All lost! To prayers, to prayers, all lost!
</T>
<T>
BOATSWAIN
What, must our mouths be cold?
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
The king and prince at prayers. Lets assist them, for our case is as theirs.
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
Im out of patience.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards. This wide-chopped rascalwould thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides!
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
Hell be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him.
</T>
<T>
VOICES
(within) Mercy on us!We split, we split!Farewell, my wife and children!Farewell, brother!We split, we split, we split!
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
Lets all sink wi' th' king.
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
Lets take leave of him.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground: long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done, but I would fain die a dry death.
</T>
<T>
MIRANDA
If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
But that the sea, mounting to th' welkins cheek,
Dashes the fire out. Oh, I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her
Dashed all to pieces. Oh, the cry did knock
Against my very heart! Poor souls, they perished.
Had I been any god of power, I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
It should the good ship so have swallowed and
The fraughting souls within her.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
Be collected.
No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
Theres no harm done.
</T>
<T>
MIRANDA
Oh, woe the day!
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
No harm.
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
Of thee, my dear onethee my daughter, who
Art ignorant of what thou art, naught knowing
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell
And thy no greater father.
</T>
<T>
MIRANDA
More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
(to ALONSO)
Beseech you, sir, be merry. You have cause,
So have we all, of joy, for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common. Every day some sailors wife,
The masters of some merchant, and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe. But for the miracle
I mean our preservationfew in millions
Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
</T>
<T>
ALONSO
Prithee, peace.
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
(to ANTONIO) He receives comfort like cold porridge.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
(to SEBASTIAN) The visitor will not give him o'er so.
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
Look hes winding up the watch of his wit. By and by it will strike.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
(to ALONSO) Sir
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
(to ANTONIO) One. Tell.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
When every grief is entertained thats offered,
Comes to th' entertainer
</T>
<T>
CALIBAN
All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
By inchmeal a disease! His spirits hear me
And yet I needs must curse. But theyll nor pinch,
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' th' mire,
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em. But
For every trifle are they set upon me,
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall. Sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness.
</T>
<T>
Lo, now, lo!
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
For bringing wood in slowly. Ill fall flat.
Perchance he will not mind me.
(lies down, covered by his gaberdine)
</T>
<T>
TRINCULO
Heres neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all.
And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i' th' wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. (sees CALIBAN)

FERDINAND
There be some sports are painful, and their labor
Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone. And most poor matters
Point to rich ends. This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
The mistress which I serve quickens whats dead
And makes my labors pleasures. Oh, she is
Ten times more gentle than her fathers crabbed,
And hes composed of harshness. I must remove
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
Had never like executor. I forget,
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,
Most busiest when I do it.
</T>
<T>
MIRANDA
Alas now, pray you,
Work not so hard. I would the lightning had
Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile!
Pray, set it down and rest you. When this burns,
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
Is hard at study. Pray now, rest yourself.
Hes safe for these three hours.
</T>
<T>
STEPHANO
Tell not me. When the butt is out, we will drink water. Nota drop before. Therefore bear up and board 'em.Servant-monster, drink to me.
</T>
<T>
TRINCULO
Servant-monster? The folly of this island. They saytheres but five upon this isle. We are three of them. If th' other two be brained like us, the state totters.
</T>
<T>
STEPHANO
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee. Thy eyes arealmost set in thy head.
</T>
<T>
TRINCULO
Where should they be set else? He were a brave monsterindeed, if they were set in his tail.
</T>
<T>
STEPHANO
My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack. For mypart, the sea cannot drown me. I swam, ere I could recoverthe shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light,thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.
</T>
<T>
TRINCULO
Your lieutenant, if you list. Hes no standard.
</T>
<T>
STEPHANO
Well not run, Monsieur Monster.
</T>
<T>
TRINCULO
Nor go neither. But youll lie like dogs, and yet say nothingneither.
</T>
<T>
GONZALO
(to ALONSO) By 'r lakin, I can go no further, sir.
My old bones ache. Heres a maze trod indeed
Through forthrights and meanders. By your patience,
I needs must rest me.
</T>
<T>
ALONSO
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
Who am myself attached with weariness
To th' dulling of my spirits. Sit down and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
No longer for my flatterer. He is drowned
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
(aside to SEBASTIAN) I am right glad that hes so out of hope.
Do not for one repulse forego the purpose
That you resolved t' effect.
</T>
<T>
SEBASTIAN
(aside to ANTONIO)The next advantage
Will we take throughly.
</T>
<T>
ANTONIO
(aside to SEBASTIAN)Let it be tonight,
For now they are oppressed with travel. They
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
As when they are fresh.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
(to FERDINAND) If I have too austerely punished you,
Your compensation makes amends, for I
Have given you here a third of mine own life
Or that for which I livewho once again
I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast of her,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her.
</T>
<T>
FERDINAND

I do believe it
Against an oracle.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
Then as my gift and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But
If thou dost break her virgin knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be ministered,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow, but barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,
As Hymens lamps shall light you.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
Now does my project gather to a head.
My charms crack not, my spirits obey, and time
Goes upright with his carriage. Hows the day?
</T>
<T>
ARIEL
On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,
You said our work should cease.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
I did say so
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
How fares the king and s followers?
</T>
<T>
ARIEL
Confined together
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
Just as you left them, all prisoners, sir,
In the line grove which weather-fends your cell.
They cannot budge till your release. The king,
His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
And the remainder mourning over them,
Brimful of sorrow and dismay. But chiefly
Him that you termed, sir, the good old Lord Gonzalo,
His tears run down his beard like winters drops
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
That if you now beheld them, your affections
Would become tender.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
Dost thou think so, spirit?
</T>
<T>
ARIEL
Mine would, sir, were I human.
</T>
<T>
PROSPERO
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
And what strength I haves mine own,
Which is most faint. Now, tis true,
I must be here confined by you,
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
Since I have my dukedom got
And pardoned the deceiver, dwell
In this bare island by your spell,
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands.
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill, or else my project fails,
Which was to please. Now I want
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
And my ending is despair,
Unless I be relieved by prayer,
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardoned be,
Let your indulgence set me free.
</T>
