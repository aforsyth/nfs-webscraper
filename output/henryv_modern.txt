CHORUS
If only we had divine inspiration, our play might rise to the highest level of imagination. If we had a stage as big as a kingdom, real kings and queens to act the part of kings and queens, and royalty to also witness the glorious spectacle, then it would be as it really was. Then valiant King Harry would resemble the god of war, as he did in life, and famine, sword, and fire would sit like dogs at his feet, waiting to be unleashed.
But, ladies and gentlemen, since thats not the case, you must forgive us plain, ordinary men who dare to act out so great a story on this humble stage. Can this theater seem to contain the sweeping fields of France? Could we even squeeze into this little theater the helmets that looked so frightening at Agincourt? Hardly! But, pardon us, because just as a few strokes of a pen, a few zeros, can signify a huge number, we, who are zeros in this great story, can work on your imagination. Pretend that within the confines of this theater sit two great kingdoms divided by a narrow but perilous ocean. Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections. Divide each man into a thousand, and there you will have an imaginary army. Imagine, when we talk of horses, that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth. Because now it is your thoughts that must dress up our kings and transport them from place to place. Your thoughts must leap over huge spans of time, turning the events of many
</T>
<T>
years into the space of a few hours. To that end, consider me a sort of chorus, here to help tell the story. And, as the speaker of any prologue should, I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly.

CANTERBURY
My lord, this bill thats being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henrys reign. Everyone thought it would pass then, and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time, which required the matter to be put off.
</T>
<T>
ELY
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
We have to think about that. If it does pass, the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses, because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy, pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, six thousand two hundred squires, and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers, old-age pensioners, the poor, and those too weak or sick to work. Add to that a yearly sum of a thousand pounds to go directly into the kings coffers. Thats what the bill says.
</T>
<T>
ELY
That would be quite a drain.
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
It would drain us dry.
</T>
<T>
ELY
But what can be done to prevent it?
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
The king is virtuous and kind.
</T>
<T>

And a true lover of the holy Church.

CANTERBURY
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time.
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Thank you, Im sure. My learned lord, kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldnt bar me in my claim. And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, that you should invent, twist, or distort your interpretation, or burden your conscience by subtly arguing for false claims. For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do. So think carefully before you incite me

CHORUS
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet. Armorers are doing great business, and all men think about is honor. People are selling off their land to buy warhorses so they can follow the exemplary king into battle as if they had winged feet, like MercuryIn Roman mythology, Mercury is the messenger of the gods, often de picted with winged feet.Mercury. Theres a sense of anticipation in the air. In the minds of Harry and his followers, visions of the kingdoms, spoils, and titles to be won eclipse thoughts of actual fighting. The French, meanwhile, have been forewarned of all this preparation by their spies and tremble in fear. They seek to derail the English with cowardly tricks. Oh, England! You are physically small but inwardly great, like a mighty heart enclosed in a small body. There is nothing you couldnt accomplish if all your subjects were loyal and loving! But, see, the king of France has detected your weak spot: a nest of faithless traitors, whose treachery he has purchased with gold. Three corrupt menRichard, earl of Cambridge; Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham; and Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberlandhave agreed to conspire with the French in exchange for money. The gracious king will die by their hands in Southampton before he sets sail for Franceif Hell and treason have their way. Stick with us, ladies and gentlemen, and well make a play, conquering space and time. Imagine that the traitors have been paid and made their choice. The king has left London, and the scene now

For my part, I really dont care. I dont say much, but when the time comes, well smile at each other. But thats as it may be. I wont fight, but I can close my eyes and take a swipe with my swordjust a simple sword, but so what? Its good enough to toast cheese, and it will survive cold as well as another mans sword. And thats that.

HOSTESS
Oh, no, hes surely not in hell. Hes in Arthurs bosomThe hostess means Abrahams bosom, the proverbial resting place of good Christians, but has King Arthur on the brain.Arthurs bosom, if any man ever went to Arthurs bosom. He died as peacefully as a baby. He departed right between twelve and one, just as the tide was turning. For after I saw him fumbling with the sheets and playing with imaginary flowers and smiling at the ends of his fingers, I knew it was the end. His face was gaunt and he was babbling about green fields. Now, now, Sir John! I said. Whats all this? Cheer up! And he called out God, God, God! three or four times. To soothe him, I told him not to think of God, that I hoped it wasnt yet time to bother with such thoughts. So he asked me to put more blankets on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt his feet, and they were stone-cold. Then I felt his legs, and they were stone-cold, and so I moved upward and upward, and his whole body was stone-cold.
</T>

NYM
They say he cried out against sherry.
</T>
<T>
HOSTESS
Yes, he did.

CHORUS
And so, on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought, our scene flies swiftly on. Imagine that you have seen the well-equipped king at Dover pier set sail in full royal regalia and his noble fleet fan the rising sun with its silken banners. Give your imagination free rein. Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging. Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub. Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea, breasting the high waves. Pretend that youre standing on the shore, watching a city dance on the shifting waves, and youll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur. Follow it, follow it! Hitch your minds to this navys sterns and leave your England, silent as midnight, guarded by grandfathers, babies, and old women. For what male subject is there old enough for his chin to be graced with even one hair who doesnt want to follow this select band of hand-picked knights to France? Once there, make your thoughts work harder, and witness a siege. Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur. Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Attack the breach in the city wall once more, dear friends, attack it once moreor else lets close it up with English corpses. In peacetime, nothing looks better in a man than restraint and humility. But when the battle trumpet blows in our ears, then its time to act like the tiger. With muscles taut and blood stirred up, hide your civilized nature under the guise of ugly rage. Lend your eyes a terrifying gleam and let them jut out from the portholes of the head like brass cannon. Make your brow jut out over your eyes like a frightening cliff over the wild and desolate ocean. Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare. Take a deep breath and draw on every impulse to its fullest strength. On, on, you noblest Englishmen, descended as you are from battle-tested fathers, fathers who, like so many Alexander the Greats, have fought in these regions from morning until night, sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight. Dont dishonor your mothers! Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you. Serve as an example to men of common birth and teach them how to fight. And you, good farmers, whose limbs were made in England, show us here the vigor of your upbringing. Prove you are worthy of your birth, which I do not doubt for a moment. For there isnt one of you so low-born that your eyes dont shine with noble luster. I see youre standing like greyhounds

BARDOLPH
On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach!
</T>

Please, corporal, stop! The fighting is too violent. Speaking for myself, I only have one life, not dozens. Too violent! Thats just how it is, the plain truth of it.

The plain truth doesnt lie. You can see how it is all around. Fighting comes and goes, Gods loyal servants drop and die. (he sings)

KING HENRY
What has the governor of the town decided? This is the final discussion I will grant. So submit to my mercy or, like men who revel in their own destruction, challenge me to do my worst. For, as I am a soldier, the name I think suits me best, once I begin my attack on Harfleur again, I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes. The gates of mercy will be closed by then, and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers, who have tasted blood, will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want, mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants. What will it matter to me, since you will have brought it on yourselves, if sacrilegious war, dressed in red like Satan, his face blackened by smoke, should commit every form of savage destruction and ruin? What will it matter to me if your innocent maidens are raped, since you will have asked for it? What power can rein in promiscuous evil once its gotten rolling? We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting. Therefore, you men of Harfleur, take pity on your town and on your people while I still have control over my men, while the cool and moderate winds of mercy still have power to disperse the depraved, infected clouds of murder, plunder, and crazed soldiers defile your shrieking daughters with their foul hands, and your fathers dragged by their silver beards, their reverend heads dashed against the walls. Expect to see your naked babies skewered upon pikes while their

What a long night this is! I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs. He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs. Hes a flying horse, a Pegasus, breathing fire out of his nostrils. When I sit astride him, I soar, I am a hawk. He trots on air. The earth sings when he touches it. The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pans pipe.

ORLANS
Hes the color of nutmeg.

And hot as ginger. He is an animal worthy of Perseus. He is pure air and fire. The duller elements of earth and water have no part in him, except in the moment of patient stillness when his rider mounts him. He is indeed worthy of the name horse, and you can call all the rest beasts.

CHORUS
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe. From camp to camp through the dark cave of night, the noise from both armies grows so quiet that those standing watch almost think they can hear the whispered secrets of one anothers sentinels. One by one, fires are lit on both sides, and through their pale flames, each army thinks he sees the smoke-tinged faces of the other. The horses of each army answer one anothers proud, threatening neighs as they pierce the dull night, and from the tents the sound of the blacksmiths' hammers as they fit out the knights, closing rivets up, adds a note of fear to the preparations. The country cocks crow and the clocks toll, sounding a drowsy three o'clock in the morning. Proud of their army and secure in their numbers, the confident and overeager French play dice, betting on how many worthless Englishmen each will capture. They scold the limping, slowly moving night, which, like an ugly old woman, takes so long to pass. The poor doomed English, like sacrificial beasts, sit patiently, and privately contemplate the dangers that will arrive with morning. With their grave faces, emaciated cheeks, and war-torn coats, they seem to the gazing moon like so many horrifying ghosts. Now, whoever spots the royal captain of this ruined army walking from camp to camp, from tent to tent, let him cry Praise and glory on his head! For out he goes visiting all his troops. He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls

Gloucester, its true that we are in great danger. But our courage should only be the greater for that. Good morning, brother Bedford. God Almighty, there must be some essential goodness even in evil, if men would only look for it. In our case, our bad neighbors over their make us early risers, a healthy and sensible thing to be. Besides, they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all, a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death. Think like that, and youll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself.

My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven. Wait for mine, sweet soul. Well fly there side by side, just as we stood together as brother-knights in this glorious and well-fought battle! At this, I went to comfort him. He smiled at me close, gave me his hand, gripping me feebly, and said, My dear lord, commend my service to my king. With that, he turned and threw his wounded arm around Suffolks neck and kissed his lips. And so,

Well, I recognize this one (indicates the glove FLUELLEN wears in his cap), and I hereby challenge you. (strikes him)
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
Good God! As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire worldor even France or England!
</T>
<T>
GOWER
What is this, you villain!
</T>
<T>
WILLIAMS
Do you think Id break my oath?
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
Stand aside, Captain Gower. Ill reward treason with blows, I promise you.
</T>
<T>
WILLIAMS
Im not a traitor.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
An infamous lie! I accuse you in the name of the king. Arrest him: hes a friend of the duke of Alenons.

CHORUS
Allow me to fill in the gaps for those of you who have not read this story. As for those who have, I beg you to excuse the gaps in time, and the many people and things that cannot be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form. Lets bring the king now to Calais. Imagine him there and, having seen him there, haul him back across the sea on the wings of your imagination. Theres the coast of England: see how the sea seems to be fenced in by the men and wives and boys who line the shore, their shouts and wild applause drowning out the deep roar of the surf. As the kings ship draws near, the very ocean is like a man running before the king, preparing his way. Lets have him land and solemnly proceed to London. Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath, where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city. He refuses, as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God. Now in the factory of thought, create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets. Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar. Imagine if our own queens general returned from Ireland, having stamped out the rebellion there, as we hope he does very soon, how many people would leave the city to come welcome him. Even more people than that welcomed Harry home,

GOWER
Yes, thats true, but why are you wearing your leek today? Saint Davys Day has passed.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything. Ill tell you as my friend, Captain Gower: that rascally, mean, beggarly, lousy, bragging Pistol, whom you and yourself and all the world know to be no better than a peasantseewith no good qualities at all: he came to me yesterday and brought me bread and salt and told me to eat my leek. We were somewhere where I couldnt pick a fight with him, but Ive decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again, whereupon Ill give him a little piece of my mind.
</T>
<T>
GOWER
And here he comes, puffing himself up like a turkey.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
Never mind his puffings and his turkeys. God bless you, Ensign Pistol! You lousy, rotten, villain, God bless you!
</T>
<T>
PISTOL
Are you mad? Do you want me to cut your life short, you deceiving lowlife? Away! The smell of leek turns my stomach.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
I wonder if youd be so good, you lousy, rotten villain, to grant my wish and my request and gratify me, see, by eating this leek. Id like you to, see, because you dont like it, and because it isnt to your taste, and because it doesnt agree with you.

QUEEN ISABEL
Brother of England, may this meeting prove as fruitful as it is joyous. We are glad to look upon your facea face whose eyes have until now carried in them a glance as deadly, for any Frenchman they alighted on, as the poisonous eyes of those mythical lizards, the basilisks. We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship.
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Were here to say amen to that.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ISABEL
All you English princes, I salute you.
