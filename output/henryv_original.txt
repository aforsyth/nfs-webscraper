CHORUS
Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend
The brightest heaven of invention!
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels,
Leashed in like hounds, should famine, sword, and fire
Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
The flat unraisd spirits that hath dared
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
So great an object. Can this cockpit hold
The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram
Within this wooden O the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?
O pardon, since a crookd figure may
Attest in little place a million,
And let us, ciphers to this great account,
On your imaginary forces work.
Suppose within the girdle of these walls
Are now confined two mighty monarchies
Whose high upreard and abutting fronts
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.
Into a thousand parts divide one man,
And make imaginary puissance.
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth,
For tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
</T>
<T>
Turning th' accomplishment of many years
Into an hour-glass; for the which supply,
Admit me chorus to this history;
Who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray
Gently to hear, kindly to judge our play.
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
My lord, Ill tell you that self bill is urged
Which in th' eleventh year of the last kings reign
Was like, and had indeed against us passed
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question.
</T>
<T>
ELY
But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
We lose the better half of our possession,
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the Church
Would they strip from us, being valued thus:
As much as would maintain, to the Kings honor,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
And to the coffers of the King besides,
A thousand pounds by th' year. Thus runs the bill.
</T>
<T>
ELY
This would drink deep.
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
'Twould drink the cup and all.
</T>
<T>
ELY
But what prevention?
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
The king is full of grace and fair regard.
</T>
<T>
ELY
And a true lover of the holy Church.

WESTMORELAND
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolved,
Before we hear him, of some things of weight
That task our thoughts concerning us and France.
</T>
<T>
CANTERBURY
God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it.
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Sure we thank you.
My learnd lord, we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salic that they have in France
Or should or should not bar us in our claim.
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate, whose right
Suits not in native colors with the truth;
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
</T>
<T>
CHORUS
Now all the youth of England are on fire,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.
Now thrive the armorers, and honors thought
Reigns solely in the breast of every man.
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings
With wingd heels, as English Mercurys.
For now sits Expectation in the air
And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point,
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets
Promised to Harry and his followers.
The French, advised by good intelligence
Of this most dreadful preparation,
Shake in their fear, and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes.
O England, model to thy inward greatness,
Like little body with a mighty heart,
What mightst thou do, that honor would thee do,
Were all thy children kind and natural!
But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
With treacherous crowns, and three corrupted men
One, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland
Have, for the gilt of France (Oh, guilt indeed!),
Confirmed conspiracy with fearful France,
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
If hell and treason hold their promises,
</T>

For my part, I care not. I say little, but when time shallserve, there shall be smiles; but that shall be as it may. I darenot fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron. It is asimple one, but what though? It will toast cheese, and it willendure cold as another mans sword will, and theres an end.

The king hath note of all that they intend,
By interception which they dream not of.

Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
Whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors
That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
His sovereigns life to death and treachery!

<T>
KING HENRY
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
Think you not that the powers we bear with us
Will cut their passage through the force of France,
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them?
</T>

No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

No; for my manly heart doth earn.Bardolph, be blithe.Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.Boy, bristle thy courageup. For Falstaff, he is dead, and we must earn therefore.

<T>
BARDOLPH
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either inheaven or in hell.
</T>
<T>
HOSTESS
Nay, sure, hes not in hell! Hes in Arthurs bosom, if everman went to Arthurs bosom. He made a finer end, andwent away an it had been any christom child. He partedev'n just between twelve and one, ev'n at the turning o' th'tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and playwith flowers and smile upon his fingers end, I knew therewas but one way, for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and hetold of green fields. How now, Sir John? quoth I. What,man, be o' good cheer! So he cried out God, God, God!three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him heshould not think of God. I hoped there was no need totrouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So he bade melay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed andfelt them, and they were as cold as any stone. Then I felt tohis knees, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold asany stone.
</T>
<T>
NYM
They say he cried out of sack.
</T>
<T>
HOSTESS
Ay, that he did.
</T>
<T>
CHORUS
Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
Embark his royalty, and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.
Play with your fancies and in them behold,
Upon the hempen tackle, shipboys climbing.
Hear the shrill whistle, which doth order give
To sounds confused. Behold the threaden sails,
Borne with th' invisible and creeping wind,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,
Breasting the lofty surge. Oh, do but think
You stand upon the rivage and behold
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing,
For so appears this fleet majestical
Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance,
For who is he whose chin is but enriched
With one appearing hair that will not follow
These culled and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege.
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
Suppose th' Ambassador from the French comes back,
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,
Or close the wall up with our English dead!
In peace theres nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility,
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger:
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage,
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect,
Let pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon, let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully as doth a galld rock
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof,
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonor not your mothers. Now attest
That those whom you called fathers did beget you.
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
The mettle of your pasture. Let us swear
That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not,
</T>
<T>
BARDOLPH
On, on, on, on, on! To the breach, to the breach!
</T>
<T>
NYM
Pray thee, corporal, stay. The knocks are too hot, and, formine own part, I have not a case of lives. The humor of it istoo hot; that is the very plainsong of it.
</T>
<T>
PISTOL
The plainsong is most just, for humors do abound.
(sings)
Knocks go and come. Gods vassals drop and die,
And sword and shield
In bloody field
Doth win immortal fame.

Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give all myfame for a pot of ale, and safety.

My purpose should not fail with me,
But thither would I hie.

As bird doth sing on bough.

Up to the breach, you dogs! Avaunt, you cullions!
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit.
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
Or, like to men proud of destruction,
Defy us to our worst. For, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the batt'ry once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
Till in her ashes she lie burid.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand, shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants.
What is it then to me if impious war,
Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do with his smirched complexion all fell feats
Enlinked to waste and desolation?
What is t to me, when you yourselves are cause,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon th' enragd soldiers in their spoil
As send precepts to the Leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace

The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
Spurt up so suddenly into the clouds

Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
Mort de ma vie, if they march along
Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom

In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

Dieu de batailles, where have they this mettle?

FLUELLEN
The duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heartand my duty and my life and my living and my uttermostpower. He is not, God be praised and blessed, any hurt inthe world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, withexcellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant thereat the pridge. I think in my very conscience he is as valianta man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation inthe world, but I did see him do as gallant service.

</T>
<T>
DAUPHIN
What a long night is this! I will not change my horse withany that treads but on four pasterns. ha! He boundsfrom the earth, as if his entrails were hairs, le cheval volant,the Pegasus, qui a les narines de feu. When I bestride him,I soar; I am a hawk; he trots the air. The earth sings when hetouches it. The basest horn of his hoof is more musical thanthe pipe of Hermes.
</T>
<T>
ORLANS
Hes of the color of the nutmeg.
</T>
<T>
DAUPHIN
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He ispure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and waternever appear in him, but only in patient stillness while hisrider mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jadesyou may call beasts.
</T>
<T>
CHORUS
Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,
The hum of either army stilly sounds,
That the fixed sentinels almost receive
The secret whispers of each others watch.
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
Each battle sees the others umbered face.
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
Piercing the nights dull ear; and from the tents
The armorers, accomplishing the knights,
With busy hammers closing rivets up,
Give dreadful note of preparation.
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
And, the third hour of drowsy morning named,
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
The confident and overlusty French
Do the low-rated English play at dice
And chide the cripple, tardy-gaited night,
Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
So tediously away. The poor condemnd English,
Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
The mornings danger; and their gesture sad,
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts. Oh, now, who will behold
The royal captain of this ruined band
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
Gloucester, tis true that we are in great danger.
The greater therefore should our courage be.
Good morrow, brother Bedford. God almighty,
There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
Would men observingly distill it out.
For our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,
Which is both healthful and good husbandry.
Besides, they are our outward consciences
And preachers to us all, admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end.
Thus may we gather honey from the weed
And make a moral of the devil himself.
</T>
<T>
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France.

Not so, my liege, this lodging likes me better,
Since I may say, Now lie I like a king.
</T>

KING HENRY
'Tis good for men to love their present pains
Upon example. So the spirit is eased.
And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt,
The organs, though defunct and dead before,
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
With casted slough and fresh legerity.
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
Commend me to the princes in our camp,
Do my good morrow to them, and anon
Desire them all to my pavilion.

I saw him down, thrice up again and fighting.
From helmet to the spur, all blood he was.
</T>
<T>
EXETER
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
Larding the plain, and by his bloody side,
Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds,
The noble earl of Suffolk also lies.
Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over,
Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped
And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
That bloodily did yawn upon his face.
And cries aloud, Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven.
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine; then fly abreast,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field
We kept together in our chivalry.
Upon these words I came and cheered him up.
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
And with a feeble grip, says Dear my lord,
Commend my service to my sovereign.
So did he turn, and over Suffolks neck
</T>

</T>
<T>
GOWER

</T>
<T>
WILLIAMS

</T>
<T>

CHORUS
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story
That I may prompt them; and of such as have,
I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse
Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented. Now we bear the king
Toward Calais. Grant him there. There seen,
Heave him away upon your wingd thoughts
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
Whose shouts and claps outvoice the deep-mouthed sea,
Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king
Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,
And solemnly see him set on to London.
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath,
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruisd helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city. He forbids it,
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,
Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent
Quite from himself, to God. But now behold,
In the quick forge and workinghouse of thought,
How London doth pour out her citizens.
The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
Like to the senators of th' antique Rome,
With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
</T>

GOWER
Nay, thats right. But why wear you your leek today? Saint
Davys day is past.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in allthings. I will tell you as my friend, Captain Gower. Therascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol,which you and yourself and all the world know to be nopetter than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is cometo me and prings me pread and salt yesterday, look you, andbid me eat my leek. It was in place where I could not breedno contention with him, but I will be so bold as to wear it inmy cap till I see him once again, and then I will tell him alittle piece of my desires.
</T>
<T>
GOWER
Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his turkey-cocks.
God pless you, Aunchient Pistol, you scurvy, lousy knave,
God pless you.
</T>
<T>
PISTOL
Ha, art thou bedlam? Dost thou thirst, base Trojan, to haveme fold up Parcas fatal web? Hence. I am qualmish at thesmell of leek.
</T>
<T>
FLUELLEN
I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my desires,and my requests, and my petitions, to eat, look you, thisleek. Because, look you, you do not love it, nor youraffections and your appetites and your digestions does notagree with it, I would desire you to eat it.

KING HENRY
Unto our brother France and to our sister,
Health and fair time of day.Joy and good wishes
To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine.
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
By whom this great assembly is contrived,
We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.
And princes French, and peers, health to you all.
Peace to this meeting wherefore we are met.
</T>
<T>
KING OF FRANCE
Right joyous are we to behold your face,
Most worthy brother England. Fairly met.
So are you, princes English, every one.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ISABEL
So happy be the issue, brother England,
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
As we are now glad to behold your eyes
Your eyes which hitherto have borne in them
Against the French that met them in their bent
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks.
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
Have lost their quality, and that this day
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
</T>
<T>
KING HENRY
To cry Amen to that, thus we appear.
</T>
<T>
QUEEN ISABEL
You English princes all, I do salute you.
