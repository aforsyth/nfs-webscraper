THESEUS
Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
Another moon. But oh, methinks how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a stepdame or a dowager
Long withering out a young mans revenue.
</T>
<T>
HIPPOLYTA
Four days will quickly steep themselves in night.
Four nights will quickly dream away the time.
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.
Turn melancholy forth to funerals.
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
</T>
<T>
Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my sword
And won thy love doing thee injuries.
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.
</T>
<T>
EGEUS
Happy be Theseus, our renownd duke.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
Thanks, good Egeus. Whats the news with thee?
</T>
<T>
EGEUS
Full of vexation come I with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius.My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander.And my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love tokens with my child.
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeatsmessengers
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.
With cunning hast thou filched my daughters heart,
Turned her obedience (which is due to me)
To stubborn harshness.And, my gracious duke,
Be it so she will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.
As she is mine, I may dispose of her
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her deathaccording to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
What say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god,
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax,
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
So is Lysander.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
In himself he is.
But in this kind, wanting your fathers voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
I would my father looked but with my eyes.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts,
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
Either to die the death or to abjure
Forever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires.
Know of your youth. Examine well your blood
Whether, if you yield not to your fathers choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessd they that master so their blood
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage.
But earthlier happy is the rose distilled
Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,
Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwishd yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
Take time to pause, and by the next new moon
The sealing day betwixt my love and me
For everlasting bond of fellowship
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your fathers will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
Or on Dianas altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
</T>
<T>
DEMETRIUS
Relent, sweet HermiaAnd, Lysander, yield
Thy crazd title to my certain right.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
You have her fathers love, Demetrius.
Let me have Hermias. Do you marry him.
</T>
<T>
EGEUS
Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
(to THESEUS) I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possessed. My love is more than his.
My fortunes every way as fairly ranked,
(If not with vantage) as Demetrius'.
Andwhich is more than all these boasts can be
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, Ill avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedars daughter, Helena,
And won her soul. And she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
I must confess that I have heard so much
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof,
But being overfull of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it.But, Demetrius, come.
And come, Egeus. You shall go with me.
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your fathers will,
Or else the law of Athens yields you up
(Which by no means we may extenuate)
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
</T>
<T>
EGEUS
With duty and desire we follow you.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth.
But either it was different in blood
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
O cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Or else misgraffd in respect of years
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
O spite! Too old to be engaged to young.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Or else it stood upon the choice of friends
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
O hell, to choose love by anothers eyes!
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentary as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night;
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,
And ere a man hath power to say Behold!
The jaws of darkness do devour it up.
So quick bright things come to confusion.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
If then true lovers have been ever crossed,
It stands as an edict in destiny.
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancys followers.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
A good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee.
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night.
And in the wood, a league without the town
</T>
<T>
Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May
There will I stay for thee.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
My good Lysander!
I swear to thee by Cupids strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burned the Carthage queen
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke
(In number more than ever women spoke),
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
Godspeed, fair Helena! Whither away?
</T>
<T>
HELENA
Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongues sweet air
More tunable than lark to shepherds ear
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching. Oh, were favor so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.
My ear should catch your voice. My eye, your eye.
My tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest Id give to be to you translated.
</T>
<T>
O, teach me how you look and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
</T>
<T>
HELENA
Oh, that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
</T>
<T>
HELENA
Oh, that my prayers could such affection move!
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
The more I hate, the more he follows me.
</T>
<T>
HELENA
The more I love, the more he hateth me.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
</T>
<T>
HELENA
None, but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
Take comfort. He no more shall see my face.
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see
Seemed Athens as a paradise to me.
Oh, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
Helen, to you our minds we will unfold.
Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
(A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal),
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
</T>
<T>
HERMIA
(to HELENA) And in the wood where often you and I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
</T>
<T>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet.
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us.
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
</T>
<T>
LYSANDER
I will, my Hermia.
</T>
<T>
Helena, adieu.
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
</T>
<T>
HELENA
How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.
He will not know what all but he do know.
And as he errs, doting on Hermias eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities.
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity.
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind.
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Nor hath Loves mind of any judgment taste
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste.
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermias eyne,
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine.
</T>
<T>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermias flight.
Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
Pursue her. And for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Is all our company here?
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Here is the scroll of every mans name which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his wedding day at night.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow to a point.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.Masters, spread yourselves.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Answer as I call you.Nick Bottom, the weaver?
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Ready. Name what part I am for and proceed.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
</T>
<T>
ROBIN
How now, spirit? Whither wander you?
</T>
<T>
FAIRY
Over hill, over dale,
Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire.
I do wander everywhere
Swifter than the moons sphere.
And I serve the fairy queen
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be.
In their gold coats spots you see.
Those be rubies, fairy favors.
In those freckles live their savors.
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslips ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits. Ill be gone.
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
</T>
<T>
ROBIN
The king doth keep his revels here tonight.
Take heed the queen come not within his sight.
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
Because that she, as her attendant hath
A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king.
She never had so sweet a changeling.
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.
But she perforce withholds the lovd boy,
Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
</T>
<T>
TITANIA
Come now, a roundel and a fairy song.
Then for the third part of a minute, hence
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
Some war with reremice for their leathern wings
To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep.
Then to your offices and let me rest.
</T>
<T>
FIRST FAIRY
(sings)
You spotted snakes with double tongue,
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.
Newts and blindworms, do no wrong.
Come not near our fairy queen.
</T>
<T>
FAIRIES
(sing)
Philomel, with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby.
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.
Never harm
Nor spell nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh.
So good night, with lullaby.
</T>
<T>
FIRST FAIRY
(sings)
Weaving spiders, come not here.
Hence, you long-legged spinners, hence!
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Are we all met?
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Pat, pat. And heres a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Peter Quince
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
</T>
<T>
SNOUT
By 'r lakin, a parlous fear.
</T>
<T>
STARVELING
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Not a whit. I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed. And for the more better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.
</T>
<T>
OBERON
I wonder if Titania be awaked.
Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
Which she must dote on in extremity.
</T>
<T>
Here comes my messenger.How now, mad spirit?
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
</T>
<T>
ROBIN
My mistress with a monster is in love.
Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented in their sport,
Forsook his scene and entered in a brake,
When I did him at this advantage take,
An asss nole I fixd on his head.
Anon his Thisbe must be answerd,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the guns report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
So at his sight away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls.
</T>
<T>
TITANIA
(to BOTTOM) Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed
While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
And stick musk roses in thy sleek, smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Wheres Peaseblossom?
</T>
<T>
PEASEBLOSSOM
Ready.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom. Wheres Monsieur Cobweb?
</T>
<T>
COBWEB
Ready.
</T>
<T>
BOTTOM
Monsieur Cobweb, good monsieur, get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a thistle. And, good monsieur, bring me the honey bag. Do not fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur. And good monsieur, have a care the honey bag break not. I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag, signor.
</T>
<T>
Wheres Monsieur Mustardseed?
</T>
<T>
MUSTARDSEED
Ready.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Have you sent to Bottoms house? Is he come home yet?
</T>
<T>
STARVELING
He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is transported.
</T>
<T>
FLUTE
If he come not, then the play is marred. It goes not forward. Doth it?
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
It is not possible. You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
</T>
<T>
FLUTE
No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens.
</T>
<T>
QUINCE
Yea, and the best person too. And he is a very paramour for a sweet voice.
</T>
<T>
FLUTE
You must say paragon. A paramour is, God bless us, a thing of naught.
</T>
<T>
SNUG
Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and there is two or three lords and ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all been made men.
</T>
<T>
FLUTE
O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life. He could not have scaped sixpence a day. An the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, Ill be hanged.
</T>
<T>
HIPPOLYTA
'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.
</T>
<T>
THESEUS
More strange than true. I never may believe
These antique fables nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet
Are of imagination all compact.
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egypt.
The poets eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth to heaven.
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poets pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy.
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
</T>
<T>
HIPPOLYTA
But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancys images
And grows to something of great constancy,
But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
</T>
