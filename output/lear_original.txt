<T>
KENT
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albanythan Cornwall.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
It did always seem so to us. But now in the division of thekingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most,for equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither canmake choice of eithers moiety.
</T>
<T>
KENT
(indicating EDMUND) Is not this your son, my lord?
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have sooften blushed to acknowledge him that now I am brazedto it.
</T>
<T>
KENT
I cannot conceive you.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Sir, this young fellows mother could, whereupon shegrew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for hercradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smella fault?
</T>
<T>
KENT
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being soproper.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year older thanthis, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knavecame something saucily to the world before he was sent for,yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making,and the whoreson must be acknowledged.Do you knowthis noble gentleman, Edmund?
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
No, my lord.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
(to EDMUND) My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter asmy honorable friend.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
My services to your lordship.
</T>
<T>
KENT
I must love you and sue to know you better.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Sir, I shall study deserving.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.
</T>
<T>
The king is coming.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
I shall, my lord.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there.Know that we have divided
In three our kingdom, and tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age,
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
Unburdened crawl toward death.Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
</T>
<T>
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now.
The two great princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughters love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answered.Tell me, my daughters,
(Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state)
Which of you shall we say doth love us most
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge?Goneril,
Our eldest born, speak first.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Sir, I do love you more than words can wield the matter,
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor,
As much as child e'er loved or father found
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable.
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
(aside) What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champains riched,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady. To thine and Albanys issue
Be this perpetual.What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Sir, I am made of that self mettle as my sister,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart,
I find she names my very deed of love
Only she comes too short, that I profess
</T>
<T>
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
Which the most precious square of sense possesses.
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear highness' love.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
(aside)Then poor Cordelia!
And yet not so, since I am sure my loves
More ponderous than my tongue.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
No less in space, validity, and pleasure
Than that conferred on Goneril.But now, our joy,
Although our last and least, to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interessed. What can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Nothing, my lord.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Nothing?
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Nothing.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
How? Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth. I love your majesty
According to my bond, no more nor less.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
Lest you may mar your fortunes.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Good my lord,
You have begot me, bred me, loved me. I
Return those duties back as are right fit
</T>
<T>
Obey you, love you, and most honor you.
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all? Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him, half my care and duty.
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
To love my father all.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
But goes thy heart with this?
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Ay, good my lord.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
So young and so untender?
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
So young, my lord, and true.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy dower.
For by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity, and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved
As thou my sometime daughter.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Good my liege
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Peace, Kent.
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I loved her most and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery.
</T>
<T>
(to CORDELIA)
Hence, and avoid my sight!
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her fathers heart from her.Call France. Who stirs?
Call Burgundy.
</T>
<T>
Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third.
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly with my power,
Preeminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights
By you to be sustained, shall our abode
Make with you by due turns. Only shall we retain
The name, and all th' additions to a king.
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
Belovd sons, be yours; which to confirm,
This coronet part between you.
(gives CORNWALL and ALBANY the coronet)
</T>
<T>
KENT
Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honored as my king,
Loved as my father, as my master followed,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers
</T>
<T>
LEAR
The bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
Thinkst thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honors bound
When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,
</T>
<T>
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Kent, on thy life, no more.
</T>
<T>
KENT
My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thy enemies, nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being motive.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Out of my sight!
</T>
<T>
KENT
See better, Lear, and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Now, by Apollo
</T>
<T>
KENT
Now, by Apollo, King,
Thou swearst thy gods in vain.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
O vassal! Miscreant!
</T>
<T>
ALBANY, CORNWALL
Dear sir, forbear!
</T>
<T>
KENT
Do, kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
Or whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,
Ill tell thee thou dost evil.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance hear me.
That thou hast sought to make us break our vows,
Which we durst never yet, and with strained pride
To come betwixt our sentence and our power,
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
</T>
<T>
Our potency made good, take thy reward:
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world.
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom. If on the next day following
Thy banished trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
This shall not be revoked.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Why, fare thee well, King. Sith thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
(to CORDELIA)
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
That justly thinkst and hast most rightly said!
(to REGAN and GONERIL)
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.
Hell shape his old course in a country new.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Heres France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
My lord of Burgundy.
We first address towards you, who with this king
Hath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love?
</T>
<T>
BURGUNDY
Most royal majesty,
I crave no more than hath your highness offered.
Nor will you tender less.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us we did hold her so,
But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
Shes there, and she is yours.
</T>
<T>
BURGUNDY
I know no answer.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Sir, will you, with those infirmities she owes
Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
Dowered with our curse and strangered with our oath
Take her or leave her?
</T>
<T>
BURGUNDY
Pardon me, royal sir.
Election makes not up in such conditions.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Then leave her, sir, for by the power that made me,
I tell you all her wealth.
(to FRANCE)For you, great King,
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you
T' avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed
Almost t' acknowledge hers.
</T>
<T>
FRANCE
This is most strange,
That she that even but now was your best object
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
Most best, most dearestshould in this trice of time
</T>
<T>
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favor. Sure, her offense
Must be of such unnatural degree
That monsters it (or your fore-vouched affection
Fall into taint), which to believe of her
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Could never plant in me.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
(to LEAR) I yet beseech your majesty,
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose notsince what I well intend,
Ill do t before I speakthat you make known
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
No unchaste action or dishonored step
That hath deprived me of your grace and favor,
But even for want of that for which I am richer:
A still-soliciting eye and such a tongue
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Go to, go to. Better thou
Hadst not been born than not t' have pleased me better.
</T>
<T>
FRANCE
Is it no more but thisa tardiness in nature
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do?My lord of Burgundy,
What say you to the lady? Loves not love
When it is mingled with regards that stands
Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
She is herself a dowry.
</T>
<T>
BURGUNDY
(to LEAR)Royal King,
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
Duchess of Burgundy.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Nothing. I have sworn. I am firm.
</T>
<T>
BURGUNDY
(to CORDELIA) I am sorry then. You have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Peace be with Burgundy.
Since that respects and fortunes are his love,
I shall not be his wife.
</T>
<T>
FRANCE
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor,
Most choice forsaken, and most loved despised!
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon,
Be it lawful I take up whats cast away.
Gods, gods! 'Tis strange that from their coldst neglect
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
Thy dowerless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.
Thou losest here, a better where to find.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Thou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. (to CORDELIA) Therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.
</T>
<T>
FRANCE
Bid farewell to your sisters.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
The jewels of our father, with washed eyes
Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,
And like a sister am most loath to call
Your faults as they are named. Love well our father.
To your professd bosoms I commit him.
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
I would prefer him to a better place.
So farewell to you both.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Prescribe not us our duty.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
At fortunes alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,
Who covers faults at last with shame derides.
Well may you prosper.
</T>
<T>
FRANCE
Come, my fair Cordelia.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what most nearlyappertains to us both. I think our father will hence tonight.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Thats most certain, and with you. Next month with us.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
You see how full of changes his age is. The observation wehave made of it hath not been little. He always loved oursister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now casther off appears too grossly.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever but slenderlyknown himself.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash. Thenmust we look from his age to receive not alone theimperfections of long-engrafted condition, but therewithalthe unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric yearsbring with them.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as thisof Kents banishment.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
There is further compliment of leave-taking betweenFrance and him. Pray you, lets sit together. If our fathercarry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this lastsurrender of his will but offend us.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
We shall further think on t.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
We must do something, and i' th' heat.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Thou, nature, art my goddess. To thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true
As honest madams issue? Why brand they us
With base, with baseness, bastardy, base, base
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull, stale, tird bed
Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops
Got tween a sleep and wake? Well then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
Our fathers love is to the bastard Edmund
As to the legitimate.Fine word, legitimate!
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top th' legitimate. I grow, I prosper.
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Kent banished thus? And France in choler parted?
And the king gone tonight, prescribed his power
Confined to exhibition? All this done
Upon the gad?Edmund, how now? What news?
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Did my father strike my gentleman
For chiding of his fool?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Ay, madam.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
By day and night he wrongs me. Every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds. Ill not endure it.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well. The fault of it Ill answer.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Hes coming, madam. I hear him.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellow servants. Ill have it come to question.
If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
Not to be overruled. Idle old man
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away! Now by my life,
Old fools are babes again and must be used
With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abused.
Remember what I have said.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Very well, madam.
</T>
<T>
KENT
If but as well I other accents borrow,
That can my speech diffuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemned,
So may it come thy master, whom thou lovest,
Shall find thee full of labors.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.
</T>
<T>
(to KENT) How now, what art thou?
</T>
<T>
KENT
A man, sir.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
</T>
<T>
KENT
I do profess to be no less than I seemto serve him trulythat will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, toconverse with him that is wise and says little, to fearjudgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
What art thou?
</T>
<T>
KENT
A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
If thou beest as poor for a subject as hes for a king, thou'rtpoor enough. What wouldst thou?
</T>
<T>
LEAR
(to KENT, giving him letters) Go you before to Gloucesterwith these letters. Acquaint my daughter no further withanything you know than comes from her demand out of theletter. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there aforeyou.
</T>
<T>
KENT
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.
</T>
<T>
FOOL
If a mans brains were in s heels, were t not in danger ofkibes?
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Ay, boy.
</T>

Then, I prithee, be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go slipshod.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Ha, ha, ha!
</T>
<T>
FOOL
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly. Forthough shes as like this as a crabs like an apple, yet I can tellwhat I can tell.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
</T>
<T>
FOOL
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou cansttell why ones nose stands i' th' middle on s face?
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Save thee, Curan.
</T>
<T>
CURAN
And you, sir. I have been with your father and given himnotice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchesswill be here with him this night.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
How comes that?
</T>
<T>
CURAN
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad?I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissingarguments.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Not I. Pray you, what are they?
</T>
<T>
CURAN
Have you heard of no likely wars toward twixt the two
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Not a word.
</T>
<T>
CURAN
You may do then in time. Fare you well, sir.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
The duke be here tonight? The betterbest!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother.
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word. Descend, brother, I say.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?
</T>
<T>
KENT
Ay.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Where may we set our horses?
</T>
<T>
KENT
I' th' mire.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
</T>
<T>
KENT
I love thee not.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Why, then, I care not for thee.
</T>
<T>
KENT
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee carefor me.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Fellow, I know thee.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
What dost thou know me for?
</T>
<T>
KENT
A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking knave;a whoreson, glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd inway of good service; and art nothing but the composition ofa knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of amongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whiningif thou deniest the least syllable of thy addition.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
I heard myself proclaimed,
And by the happy hollow of a tree
Escaped the hunt. No port is free, no place
That guard and most unusual vigilance
Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,
I will preserve myself, and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury in contempt of man
Brought near to beast. My face Ill grime with filth,
Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky.
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars, who with roaring voices
Strike in their numbed and mortified bare arms
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary,
And with this horrible object from low farms,
Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom!
Thats something yet. Edgar I nothing am.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
And not send back my messenger.
</T>
<T>

As I learned,
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove.
</T>
<T>
KENT

Ha! Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

KENT
No, my lord.

FOOL
Ha, ha! Look, he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by theheads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins,and men by the legs. When a mans overlusty at legs, thenhe wears wooden nether-stocks.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
(to KENT) Whats he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?
</T>
<T>
KENT
It is both he and she:
Your son and daughter.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
No.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Yes.

No, I say.

Whos there, besides foul weather?

<T>
GENTLEMAN
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
</T>
<T>
KENT
I know you. Wheres the king?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
Contending with the fretful elements.
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea
Or swell the curld water 'bove the main,
That things might change or cease. Tears his white hair,
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
Catch in their fury and make nothing of.
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
The to-and-froconflicting wind and rain.
This nightwherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
The lion and the belly-pinchd wolf
Keep their fur dryunbonneted he runs,
And bids what will take all.
</T>
<T>
KENT
But who is with him?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
None but the fool, who labors to outjest
His heart-struck injuries.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!
You sulfurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
Crack natures molds, all germens spill at once
That make ingrateful man!

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
I never gave you kingdom, called you children.
You owe me no subscription. Why then, let fall
Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand, your slave
A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That will with two pernicious daughters joined
Your high engendered battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. Oh, ho! 'Tis foul.

GLOUCESTER
Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing.When I desire their leave that I might pity him, they tookfrom me the use of mine own house, charged me on pain oftheir perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreatfor him, nor any way sustain him.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Most savage and unnatural!
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Go to, say you nothing. Theres a division betwixt thedukes. And a worse matter than that: I have received a letterthis night. 'Tis dangerous to be spoken. I have locked theletter in my closet. These injuries the king now bears will berevenged home. Theres part of a power already footed. Wemust incline to the king. I will look him and privily relievehim. Go you and maintain talk with the duke, that mycharity be not of him perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill andgone to bed. Though I die for itas no less is threatenedmethe king my old master must be relieved. There issome strange thing toward, Edmund. Pray you, be careful.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
Instantly know, and of that letter too.
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
That which my father losesno less than all.
The younger rises when the old doth fall.

Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.
The tyranny of the open nights too rough
For nature to endure.

Let me alone.

Good my lord, enter here.

Wilt break my heart?

I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

LEAR
Thou thinkst tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin. So tis to thee.
But where the greater malady is fixed
The lesser is scarce felt. Thoudst shun a bear,
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
Thoudst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the minds free,
The bodys delicate. The tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats therefilial ingratitude.
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to t? But I will punish home.
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out! Pour on, I will endure.
In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril,
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all
Oh, that way madness lies. Let me shun that.
No more of that.

CORNWALL
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

<T>
EDMUND
How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus givesway to loyalty, something fears me to think of.
</T>
<T>
CORNWALL
I now perceive it was not altogether your brothers evildisposition made him seek his death, but a provoking meritset awork by a reprovable badness in himself.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just!(giving CORNWALL a letter) This is the letter which he spokeof, which approves him an intelligent party to theadvantages of France. O heavens, that this treason werenot, or not I the detector!
</T>
<T>
CORNWALL
Go with me to the duchess.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mightybusiness in hand.

CORNWALL
True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek outwhere thy father is, that he may be ready for ourapprehension.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
(aside) If I find him comforting the king, it will stuff hissuspicion more fully.(to CORNWALL)I will persevere in my course of loyalty, though the conflictbe sore between that and my blood.

CORNWALL
I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer fatherin my love.

Here is better than the open air. Take it thankfully. I willpiece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not belong from you.

(to GONERIL) Post speedily to my lord your husband. Showhim this letter. The army of France is landed.Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

REGAN
Hang him instantly.

GONERIL
Pluck out his eyes.
</T>
<T>
CORNWALL
Leave him to my displeasure.Edmund, keep you oursister company. The revenges we are bound to take uponyour traitorous father are not fit for your beholding. Advisethe duke where you are going, to a most festinatepreparation. We are bound to the like. Our posts shall beswift and intelligent betwixt us.Farewell, dear sister.(to EDMUND) Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.
</T>
<T>
How now? Wheres the king?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.
Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,
Who with some other of the lords dependants
Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast
To have well-armd friends.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Yet better thus, and known to be contemned,
Than still contemned and flattered. To be worst,
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
The lamentable change is from the best;
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts.
</T>
<T>
But who comes here?
My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
Life would not yield to age.
</T>
<T>
OLD MAN
(to GLOUCESTER)O my good lord,
I have been your tenant and your fathers tenantthese fourscore years.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Away, get thee away. Good friend, be gone.
Thy comforts can do me no good at all.
Thee they may hurt.
</T>
<T>
OLD MAN
Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
I have no way, and therefore want no eyes.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way.
</T>
<T>
Now, wheres your master?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Madam, withinbut never man so changed.
I told him of the army that was landed.
He smiled at it. I told him you were coming.
His answer was The worse. Of Gloucesters treachery
And of the loyal service of his son,
When I informed him, then he called me sot,
And told me I had turned the wrong side out.
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
What like, offensive.
</T>
<T>
GONERIL
(to EDMUND)
Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
That dares not undertake. Hell not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers.
I must change names at home, and give the distaff
Into my husbands hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear
If you dare venture in your own behalf
A mistresss command. Wear this. Spare speech.
Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
(kisses EDMUND) Conceive, and fare thee well.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know youthe reason?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
Something he left imperfect in the state which, since hiscoming forth, is thought of; which imports to the kingdomso much fear and danger that his personal return was mostrequired and necessary.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Who hath he left behind him general?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
The Marshal of France, Monsieur la Far.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration ofgrief?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,
And now and then an ample tear trilled down
Her delicate cheek. It seemed she was a queen
Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,
Sought to be king o'er her.
</T>
<T>
KENT
O, then it moved her?
</T>
<T>
GENTLEMAN
Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at onceher smiles and tears
Were like a better way. Those happy smilets
That played on her ripe lip seemed not to know
What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence
As pearls from diamonds dropped. In brief,
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved
If all could so become it.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Alack, tis he. Why, he was met even now
As mad as the vexed sea, singing aloud,
Crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn.A century send forth.
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.
</T>
<T>
What can mans wisdom
In the restoring his bereavd sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
There is means, madam.
Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
The which he lacksthat to provoke in him
Are many simples operative, whose power
Will close the eye of anguish.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
All blessed secrets,
All you unpublished virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears. Be aidant and remediate
In the good mans distress. Seek, seek for him,
Lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.
</T>
<T>
SECOND MESSENGER
News, madam.
The British powers are marching hitherward.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
But are my brothers powers set forth?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Ay, madam.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Himself in person there?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
Madam, with much ado.
Your sister is the better soldier.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
No, madam.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
What might import my sisters letter to him?
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
I know not, lady.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucesters eyes being out,
To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us. Edmund I think is gone
In pity of his misery to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover to descry
The strength o' th' enemy.
</T>
<T>
OSWALD
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Our troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us.
The ways are dangerous.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
When shall we come to th' top of that same hill?
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
You do climb up it now. Look how we labor.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Methinks the ground is even.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Horrible steep.
Hark, do you hear the sea?
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
No, truly.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Why then, your other senses grow imperfect
By your eyes' anguish.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
So may it be indeed.
Methinks thy voice is altered, and thou speakst
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Youre much deceived. In nothing am I changed
But in my garments.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Methinks youre better spoken.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Come on, sir. Heres the place. Stand still. How fearful
And dizzy tis to cast ones eyes so low!
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down
Hangs one that gathers samphiredreadful trade!
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice. And yon tall anchoring bark,
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
And every measure fail me.
</T>
<T>
KENT
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
All my reports go with the modest truth,
Nor more, nor clipped, but so.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Be better suited.
These weeds are memories of those worser hours.
I prithee, put them off.
</T>
<T>
KENT
Pardon, dear madam.
Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
My boon I make it that you know me not
Till time and I think meet.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
Then be t so, my good lord.
How does the king?
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
Madam, sleeps still.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
O you kind gods,
Cure this great breach in his abusd nature,
Th' untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up,
Of this child-changd father!
</T>
<T>
DOCTOR
So please your majesty
That we may wake the king? He hath slept long.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
(to a gentleman) Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
Or whether since he is advised by aught
To change the course. Hes full of alteration
And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Our sisters man is certainly miscarried.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
'Tis to be doubted, madam.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
Now, sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you.
Tell me but trulybut then speak the truth
Do you not love my sister?
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
In honored love.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
But have you never found my brothers way
To the forfended place?
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
That thought abuses you.
</T>
<T>
REGAN
I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosomed with her as far as we call hers.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
No, by mine honor, madam.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.
If ever I return to you again,
Ill bring you comfort.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
Grace go with you, sir.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
Away, old man. Give me thy hand. Away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
Give me thy hand. Come on.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
No further, sir. A man may rot even here.
</T>
<T>
EDGAR
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence even as their coming hither.
Ripeness is all. Come on.
</T>
<T>
GLOUCESTER
And thats true too.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Some officers take them away. Good guard
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them.
</T>
<T>
CORDELIA
(to LEAR)
We are not the first
Who with best meaning have incurred the worst.
For thee, oppressd King, I am cast down.
Myself could else outfrown false fortunes frown.
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
</T>
<T>
LEAR
No, no, no, no! Come, lets away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, Ill kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness. So well live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news, and well talk with them too
Who loses and who wins, whos in, whos out
And take upon s the mystery of things
As if we were Gods spies. And well wear out
In a walled prison packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by the moon.
</T>
<T>
EDMUND
Take them away.
</T>
<T>
LEAR
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
</T>
